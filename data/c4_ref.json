        "input": "WE'D BEEN SUMMONED to the office on Sunday for an emergency meeting: Our third-quarter numbers were going to fall short of analysts' expectations. Way short. We were a classic story stock, and up until then our story had been gold, from our boy-wonder founder and CEO to our proprietary technology",
        "output": "to the multibillion-dollar markets we were targeting. We had Fortune 100 partners and Nobel laureates on our board. Investors had responded by making the company one of the most highly capitalized start-ups the Nasdaq had ever seen. Yet a story stock is like a hit TV series, and we had to keep delivering exciting new episodes. We were developing a reputation for putting out news releases whenever Boy Wonder farted. The Street's expectations had begun to feel unsustainably high.\nClearly, the solution to that pesky little problem had now arrived. I was part of the communications group, and for the last week we'd been scrambling to put together a plan for announcing the first bad news in the company's five-year history. I was preoccupied with the tactical blunders we'd already made. Having decided to signal investors by announcing the bad news during a conference call with the key analysts who tracked our company, our desperate CFO had postponed the call from Wednesday to Thursday to Friday, and finally to Sunday night, which had an ominous cloak-of-darkness quality. And I was nervous about the press release, too. Boy Wonder was insisting we put out a one-paragraph statement of the numbers, with no CEO quote or statement of support from one of our eight-hundred-pound partners; no context, no perspective. Just the numbers and some boilerplate. The thing looked like an obit.\nAs usual, however, Boy Wonder had a plan: We would seize this moment to reinforce our excellent progress into full commercial operations. We would announce that the company was going to focus its resources and attention on its three most promising applications. We'd been accused of spreading ourselves too thin, chasing after opportunities in every potential market, and surely our investors would respond to this new focus and resolve.\nThe conference call went off without a hitch, and afterward we all felt the peculiar euphoria that often accompanies a decisive act. The general counsel and I made a bet on where the stock would close the next day. We'd finished up at 42 and change on Friday. He guessed 35. I guessed 30. \"Ouch,\" he said.\nWe arrived the next morning to discover that trading on our shares had opened at 26. Phones were ringing off the hook: the Times, the Journal, CNN, analysts, investors. We closed that day at 21, down 50 percent. Half a billion dollars in market capitalization-vaporized. We were the day's big loser on the Nasdaq, our performance so pitiful that even our competitors were shaken. Our tactical blunders hadn't helped, but what had really killed us was our \"good\" news. Investors were mortified that we were backing away from big markets. They didn't care if it made sense. What they wanted more than anything was to continue to fantasize about our limitless market potential, and they interpreted our newfound focus as an act of panic, if not betrayal. Within a year, the company was bankrupt.\nIf you have a good workplace war story, please send it to us at esquire-mag.com/war-stories.\nWhether you're looking for the perfect loan calculator (Loan*Calculator!

        "input": "Two years ago this week, President Kibaki and Prime Minister Raila Odinga unveiled a 40-member Grand Coalition Cabinet whose members would incidentally become architects of \u2018grand corruption\u2019.\nFrom the maize scandal, Triton scam, Free Primary Education funds theft, corruption in the water sector and recently the dubious purchase of cemetery land,",
        "output": "it has been business as usual in raiding public coffers.\nThree months into the tenure of the Coalition Cabinet, Parliament passed a censure Motion against then Finance Minister Amos Kimunya, and demanded his immediate resignation over the controversial sale of the Grand Regency Hotel, now Laicos Hotel.\nKimunya quit to pave the way for investigations into the sale and he was reappointed in January last year, after an inquiry cleared him.\nBut a probe report prepared in November 2008 by retired Chief Justice Majid Cockar-led commission into the controversial sale of the hotel to Libyans is yet to be made public.\nIn late 2008, the Government instituted measures to tackle biting famine that was abused by profiteers in the so-called \u2018maize scam\u2019.\nAt the time, the country was experiencing a severe maize shortage due to poor harvest and destruction of close to 3.5 million bags of maize during post-election violence.\nThe country\u2019s Strategic Grain Reserve held inadequate stocks and as the maize shortage worsened, prices of maize flour soared, prompting public outrage.\nResponding to popular anger in October 2008, the Government directed National Cereals and Produce Board to import three million bags of maize to ease the shortage.\nThe maize was to be sold to millers at subsidised prices to bring down the price of maize flour. Hundreds of metric tonnes of maize were imported but contrary to intended policy expectations, brokers who enjoyed political patronage turned the programme into a money-minting scheme.\nAfrica Centre for Open Governance noted companies and individuals, who were either not millers or had no milling capacity, obtained allocations riding on political patronage.\nThese brokers subsequently sold the maize off to genuine millers at exorbitant prices hence defeating the purpose of the programme. Conservative estimates indicated Sh3.6 billion was lost but the World Bank said the scheme cost the taxpayer Sh23 billion. The scam kicked up a storm that climaxed on February 19, last year, in Parliament where Agriculture Minister William Ruto survived a censure Motion.\nThe scandal left several leading international companies involved in financing oil imports as well as the Kenya Commercial Bank, who had all financed Triton to import the oil, at risk of losing a whopping Sh7.6 billion ($98.7 million).\nThe collateral financing system had been introduced to allow independent players who could not import commercially viable quantities, but with the collusion of unscrupulous officials, it had become a cash cow.\nAfter a short break, the maize saga resurfaced in May when a parliamentary report by MP John Mututho-led Agriculture Committee recommended further investigations.\nBut Prime Minister Raila Odinga fought back saying: \"These allegations around maize are being pushed by corruption cartels that see the Prime Minister as stopping them from dipping their way into the granary.\"\nEventually on May 15, Parliament in a session with 15 MPs trashed the parliamentary report terming it malicious and aimed at settling political scores.\nLast December, the Ministry of Education was thrown into a crisis after UK officials suspended funding, citing the loss of about Sh100 million meant to fund free primary education.\nA month earlier, the National Water Conservation and Pipeline Corporation board had been dissolved in the wake of corruption allegations and concerns irregularities had sunk the firm in a Sh750 million debt.\nThe water scam, however, was eclipsed by the attention drawn to the FPE scandal as the US Government, too, withdrew $7 million (Sh538 million) in aid to the embattled ministry until those implicated in the theft are prosecuted.\nThe money was looted in inflated expenses and payments for fictitious workshops. The UK Government has since stated the Government would not touch a single coin of the Sh2.3 billion lined up this month. The money would be channelled through agencies \"outside of Government channels\". Raila joined growing calls for Education Minister Sam Ongeri and PS Karega Mutahi to step aside over missing Free Primary Education funds.\nBut a groundswell erupted in the Premier\u2019s own office in February, as the ghost of the maize scam stirred following a leaked report from an independent probe by an international audit firm.\nThe PricewaterhouseCoopers audit report, which exposed how fictitious companies raked in millions of shillings and was extensively covered in the media on February 10, named top officials, including two in the PM\u2019s office, PS Mohamed Isahakia and Administrative secretary Caroli Omondi.\nIts release triggered a chain of events that culminated in a standoff in Government between the coalition partners. It began on the morning of February 13 when Isahakia and Omondi resigned, at the Raila\u2019s directive, to allow for investigations.\nBut that evening President Kibaki announced the suspensions of several top officials, including the two, pending further investigations into their roles in the maize and FPE scams.\nThe following day Raila announced the suspensions of Ruto and Ongeri over maize and FPE scandals, but that evening the President lifted the suspensions terming the PM\u2019s action illegal.\nThis triggered a standoff that made it impossible to hold regular Cabinet meetings.\nBut it is the outrageous cemetery scandal in which City Hall bought 120 acres of land worth Sh24 million for Sh259 million that showed corruption cartels have become bolder and greedier.\nA KACC probe report gave a detailed flow chart on how the conspiracy to defraud taxpayer was allegedly plotted and how the loot was shared out among public servants and lawyers involved in the shady deal. President Kibaki interdicted Local Government PS Sammy Kirui and 12 senior officials to pave the way for investigations.\nA damning parliamentary report by the departmental committee on Local Authorities, which recommends Deputy Prime Minister Musalia Mudavadi steps aside pending investigations into the scandal, is due to be debated in Parliament.\nMudavadi has since claimed innocence, blamed the cemetery scandal on politics, citing KACC\u2019s conduct.\nInstead of reporting its investigations to the Attorney General for possible prosecution as Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act 2003 requires, it was sent to the Prime Minister and the Head of the Civil Service Francis Muthaura."

If approved by the voters in November, the tax hike would start in January 2018 and remain in place for 20 years.\n\u201cIf we are really going to deliver results to the people of Colorado, we need everybody at the table \u2014 Republicans and Democrats. I think this is an example of that,\u201d Duran, of Denver, said in an interview.\nThe legislation, details of which were first reported by The Denver Post, also would redirect $50 million in existing revenue to roads and decrease annual vehicle registration fees by $75 million a year. The total package would generate an estimated $677 million a year for transportation.\nThe registration fee on small cars would decrease from $23 to $9, while the rate on motorcycles would fall from $16 to $6. The levy on larger passenger vehicles goes from $28 to $11.\nThe deal represents a compromise on both sides: It pulls from existing revenues, a point Democrats dislike, and it represents an increase in total revenue, a problem for conservatives.\nGov. John Hickenlooper called for a voter referendum in his State of the State address in January and continued to express optimism Wednesday about the potential for a consensus bill.\n\u201cI\u2019m open to pretty much any way to fund it,\u201d he told reporters, emphasizing that transportation is not a partisan issue.\nThe Colorado Department of Transportation has identified $9 billion in need for the state\u2019s transportation system, which is suffering from a population boom and limited maintenance dollars.\nThe top priorities are the expansion of Interstate 70 through the mountains and widening of Interstate 25 north and south of Denver.\nThe $677 million in total transportation dollars outlined in the legislation would split into three buckets.\nThe majority of the money \u2014 $350 million \u2014 would go toward a payments on a potential $3.5 billion bond package.\nThe remaining share would be split with 70 percent to local governments for road improvements and 30 percent earmarked for transit-oriented projects.\nThe local government share is projected to reach near $216 million in the first year. Another portion, estimated at $92 million, would go to local areas in the form of matching grants awarded by a new commission created in the legislation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s statewide. There\u2019s something in here for everyone,\u201d said Rep. Diane Mitsch Bush, a D-Steamboat Springs and the House transportation chairwoman.\n\u201cThe deal, as we understand it, attempts to strike the right balance between the priorities of the leadership in both houses while considering what might be viable with voters,\u201d said Sandra Hagen Solin, who is with Fix Colorado Roads.\nIn her interview with The Post, Duran emphasized that the legislation includes provisions to make the spending transparent to voters, including a public website to track the spending and a committee to oversee the bonding.\nNot all applauded the compromise plan. Americans for Prosperity, a conservative organization that blocked legislative attempts in recent years to increase spending, noted how it represents a tax hike \u2014 a 21 percent increase in the state sales tax."

        "output": "received hundreds of calls in the past two days, some from stranded Arrow drivers and even more from fellow truck drivers who have called in offering assistance to help the drivers get home. OOIDA staff kicked into high gear Wednesday matching help requests from Arrow drivers with truckers and friends who volunteered to provide assistance.\nLate Tuesday afternoon, OOIDA had set up a support page for stranded Arrow drivers on Facebook. As of press time on Wednesday, the site had more than 1,600 fans. Some of those who posted comments were out of fuel and were stranded. But the overwhelming number of people who have posted comments were offering rides, money and even a place to stay until they could arrange transportation home.\nMany Arrow drivers woke up Tuesday to the \u201cNightmare Before Christmas\u201d to find out they were without jobs and needed to turn their trucks into the nearest Freightliner or International dealership.\nArrow driver Jeff Smith, who lives near Nashville, TN, had an inkling that something was wrong on Monday night when he tried to fuel up at a truck stop in Ohio. He found out that his fuel card had been turned off and he had no fuel to go any further.\nTo make things worse, it was 18 degrees outside and not much warmer inside Smith\u2019s truck.\nShe said several drivers at that truck stop pitched in with fuel money so Smith could make it another 500 miles to get home. She said he\u2019s now looking at ways to pay it forward to help other drivers who are in similar predicaments.\nThis is just one example of kindness Arrow drivers have received from other drivers out on the road.\nTrucker Tyree Samson said he and another Arrow driver were parked at the Houston terminal when they heard the news that the company was closing and they were to get off the lot. He said he and the other driver drove to a truck stop in Baytown, TX, where almost immediately other drivers stepped in with offers to help.\nFearful that their trucks would be repossessed if they left to go inside for food, a fellow driver parked his truck long-ways in an effort to block potential tow trucks from snatching their trucks before they could clear them out.\nBoth Daimler and Navistar Financial have offered to find Arrow drivers bus tickets on Greyhound Lines Inc. or $200 for their transportation costs.\nDrivers with Freightliner or Kenworths are to call 877-294-9679 for assistance.\nDrivers of International trucks are to call Navistar at 800-233-9121. Sara Mee, manager of communications for Navistar, said drivers who have a lease-purchase agreement with Arrow are to call that number for assistance as well.\nArrow drivers who need assistance can call OOIDA at 800-444-5791 and press 1, and leave their name and phone number where they can be reached. Land Line\u2019s Facebook page will be monitored over the weekend.\nNavistar\u2019s Mee said staff there will also be available in case drivers need guidance."

They say he was complicit in the killing of more than 800 Egyptian protesters last year.\nFormer Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak, who has been ill, arrives by gurney to court in Cairo, Egypt, Jan. 5, 2012.\nThe prosecutor",
        "output": "in the trial of Hosni Mubarak demanded on Thursday that the ousted Egyptian leader be sentenced to hang on charges of complicity in the killing of protesters during last year's uprising against his rule.\nMustafa Khater, one of a five-member prosecution team, also asked the judge for the death sentence for Mubarak's security chief and six top police commanders being tried in the same case.\n\"Retribution is the solution. Any fair judge must issue a death sentence for these defendants,\" said Khater on the third and final day of the prosecution's opening statement. \"We feel the spirits of the matryrs flying over this hall of sacred justice and those who lost their sight by the bullets of the defendants are stumbling around it to reach the judge and demand fair retribution from those who attacked them,\" he said.\n\"The nation and the people are awaiting a word of justice and righteousness.\"\nMubarak's two sons, one-time heir apparent Gamal and Alaa, face corruption charges in the same trial along with their father and a close family friend who is a fugitive.\nAn 18-day uprising forced Mubarak, 83, to step down on Feb. 11 after a nearly 30-year rule. The military, led by a general who served as defense minister under Mubarak for 20 years, replaced him in power.\nEarlier in Thursday's hearing, chief prosecutor Mustafa Suleiman said Mubarak was \"politically and legally\" responsible for the killing of the protesters and charged that the former president did nothing to stop the killings that he was aware of from meetings with aides, regional TV channels and reports by his security agencies.\nHe said Mubarak's security chief and co-defendant, former interior minister Habib el-Adly, authorized the use of live ammunition on orders from Mubarak.\n\"He (Mubarak) can never, as the top official, claim that he did not know what was going on,\" Suleiman told the court. \"He is responsible for what happened and must bear the legal and political responsibility for what happened. It is irrational and illogical to assume that he did not know that protesters were being targeted.\"\nAddressing Mubarak directly, Suleiman said, \"If you had not issued these orders yourself, then where was your outburst of rage over the lives of your people?\" Testimonies by two interior ministers who succeeded el-Adly, he said, pointed out that the defendant could not have given the order to use live ammunition against the protesters without Mubarak's personal approval, said Suleiman.\nSuleiman said Mubarak told investigators he decided to step down after the military refused to intervene to \"immediately and urgently\" help the security forces contain the protests. Mubarak called out the army on Jan. 28 \u2014 three days into the uprising and on the day when security forces disappeared from the streets in circumstances that have yet to be fully explained.\n\"He (Mubarak) fully knew what was happening but he did nothing,\" said Suleiman.\nAnother prosecutor, Wael Hussein, said that one of the six police commanders on trial \u2014 former chief of the hated state security agency Hassan Abdel-Rahman \u2014 has personally given orders to allow inmates to escape from a string of jails across the nation during the uprising. The escapees, who numbered in the thousands, have been blamed for a dramatic surge in crime since Jan. 28 last year when almost all vestiges of state authority collapsed.\nMost of the inmates have since been captured and returned to jail, but Egypt continues to suffer higher-than-usual crime rates."

Blame that, as Indianapolis fans usually do, on the Patriots.\n\"They're a good team, they've played great",
        "output": "football all year and we've played very, very well,\" Colts coach Tony Dungy said. \"It's going to be a big game.\"\nBoth teams enter Sunday's game with glittering resumes.\nNew England (8-0) has beaten all of its opponents by at least 17 points. Tom Brady has a mind-boggling 136.2 passer rating, new receiver Randy Moss could break the franchise's single-season record for TD catches this weekend, and only two opponents have topped 20 points this season.\nIndianapolis is merely off to another 7-0 start, already has three road wins against division opponents and just routed Jacksonville and Carolina on the road within six days of each other. The Colts lead the league in TDs rushing (12) and their run defense has jumped from 32nd last year to 13th. In fact, the Colts \u2014 yes, the Colts \u2014 have allowed fewer points per game than New England (14.6 to 15.9).\nHum ho, say the so-called experts.\nWhen debating, the focus always seems to be more on New England's chance to go 16-0 than whether the Colts can defend their home turf against a team they have beaten three consecutive times. The oddsmakers installed New England as a 4\u00bd-point favorite over the Colts. The line grew to 5 \u00bd points on Tuesay.\nPatriots coach Bill Belichick, a three-time Super Bowl winner, thinks that's no way to treat a champion.\n\"They've won a lot of games through the years, they won a championship last year and nobody's beat them in a long time,\" he said, speaking for the minority. \"So there's nobody doing it better than they are.\"\nThe truth is, the Colts and Pats are in a league of their own.\nThey're tied for the league lead in turnover margin at plus-11. The Colts have beaten stronger opponents, while New England has mastered the art of fast starts. The Colts have the league's No. 2 pass defense, the Pats the No. 1 pass offense.\nThe numbers indicate these teams have also traded identities. New England is now the team throwing all over the field, and the Colts are the team methodically cranking out victories.\nAs Dungy knows from his own experience, the pundits always seem more enamored of the team scoring more points.\n\"We went through that at one point in '04 where we scoring a lot of points and we went up there and got three points,\" Dungy said, referring to the Colts' divisional round playoff loss in Foxborough.\nStill, the Colts would rather lay low than find themselves in the glaring spotlight for a fourth consecutive year.\nThere are explanations for why New England has received so much attention and for the perception that New England is far superior. Those range from playing in a bigger media market to the high-profile changes the Patriots made during the offseason. The Pats added an entirely new receiving corps in Moss, Donte' Stallworth and Wes Welker, and signed free agent linebacker Adalius Thomas.\nThree Super Bowl wins in four years helps promote that image, too.\nThe Colts, meanwhile, reverted to their standard philosophy of moving lesser-known backups and draft picks into the lineup to offset defections and retirements.\nBoth approaches have worked perfectly. The Patriots are scoring points at a record clip, and the Colts have become more physical on both sides of the ball.\nHow that plays out Sunday is anybody's guess. But how it's playing out in the media is obvious.\n\"We need to understand we have to play the game and not the media game,\" Colts president Bill Polian said on his weekly radio show Monday night. \"The media will do its job, but we can't get caught up in all that.\"\nInstead, they'd rather earn the respect on the field, and Sunday's game will give them another chance.\n\"The point spread is there to get the betting right, it's not something we worry about,\" Dungy said. \"New England is a different challenge for us because they've got a lot of guys who can make plays. So far, so good, but it's going to be tougher against these guys.\""

MEPs have now asked for it again.\nOne year ago this month, the European Parliament promised to take measures to tackle sexual harassment. Some of its staff are unconvinced change is coming.\nFace-to-face interviews with 15,179 women reveal that beliefs in female subservience and marital obedience continue to persist in south-eastern and eastern Europe."

I'm not sure the members of the board were given fair opportunities to weigh the issues at hand,\" de Blasio said in the radio appearance.\nAt the session Tuesday night, the board's chair put up a proposal that didn't include the bike lane, which was then overwhelmingly approved.\nThe mayor said the bike lane is too important to be left out.\n\"Community boards have an advisory role to play. They get their input. We try and listen to it carefully. But when it comes to safety, the most important thing is the safety of our people,\" de Blasio said. \"We have lost people, we have lost bicyclists on Queens Blvd. We're not going to allow it to happen anymore. And everyone's got to slow down.\"\nProjects under the Vision Zero initiative have generated controversy in neighborhoods around the city, with some residents opposing them even as street safety advocates complain the city is too timid in bowing to such resistance.\n\"Part of the conflict here is that this is a culture change. This is drivers understanding that things are changing in this city. They have got to change their ways and their habits,\" de Blasio said. \"Most New Yorkers and most drivers have embraced Vision Zero with a lot of enthusiasm and understand that it's about protecting seniors and children. But some folks keep resisting.\""

Founded in the hiCenter Ventures incubator in Haifa, RescueDose latest investment is from ERA Brazil Israel, a company owned by Advocate Eric Ben-Mayor and a group of Brazilian partners. ERA Brazil Israel has invested in a variety of high-tech companies in Israel, and in medical and dental companies.\nAutomation of drug dispensing has two main advantages. The first is more accurate control of the process of preparing drugs and more accurate monitoring of the dosage. The second is protection of pharmacists against hazardous materials. Syringes with most dangerous drugs are currently prepared manually. The transition to an automated process enables a pharmacist to oversee the process. RescueDose's first line of products is designed for nuclear medicine. The company has two patents in the US and one being registered in China.\nRescueDose CEO Gilad Einy said, \"This significant financing round is a vote of confidence in the innovative product developed by the company. It will enable us to penetrate additional markets. The company has a joint project with EC Squared, the market leader in medical and nuclear pharmaceutical computer systems, with assistance from the Israel-U.S. Binational Industrial Research and Development (BIRD) Foundation. The company also has projects with companies in China, and is bringing its systems to the Chinese market. It is also entering additional medical sectors.\"\nBen-Mayor added, \"The global hospital and pharmacy automation market is estimated at $5-7 billion a year, and is projected to grow substantially in the next five years. ResdueDose specializes in automation of liquid drugs, and is developing products in nuclear medicine and chemotherapy that will be used next year in hospitals and pharmacies in Israel and worldwide. Very few companies are now supplying automated solutions in this sector.\"\nhiCenter Ventures CEO Yael Mittelman said, \"I see great potential in robotics for medical uses. I foresee that this financing round will enable the company to deepen its penetration of the markets and make it possible for it to develop applications in additional medical sectors in which IVs are frequently used.\""

        "output": "unremarkable,\" said the West Los Angeles IT specialist, 32, who visited to use up a Groupon voucher. \"Given that there are so many good places to eat in L.A., I have a really hard time saying yes to that.\"\nIncreasing apathy, particularly from younger patrons, has driven traditional Jewish delicatessens from their mid-century pinnacle. The decline seems to be accelerating partly because of health concerns over the schmaltz-spread fare and partly because bagels are now available in every supermarket.\nAdd sides of restaurant-industry slump and rising lease rates, and even local landmarks aren't immune.\nIn the last three months, three long-standing emporiums of corned beef and matzo around the country have closed.\nFaced with aging clientele and a difficult economy, Ashkenaz Delicatessen in Chicago went dark in November and was replaced by a seafood joint called Da Lobsta. In Manhattan, high rent and the recession led to the closure of 75-year-old Stage Deli.\n\"People don't open up new delis anymore because it's very, very difficult to do,\" said Marian Levine, owner of Stage's longtime rival, Carnegie Deli in Manhattan.\nIn the first half of the 20th century, several thousand Jewish delis were operating in New York. But as Jewish immigration to the East Coast ebbed after World War II and younger generations splintered into the suburbs, the number has shrunk to a few dozen.\nDemographic shifts in Los Angeles in the last few decades \u2014 along with the arrival of brands such as Langer's in MacArthur Park, Canter's on Fairfax and the Brent's chain \u2014 sparked hope of a Jewish deli revival in the Southland.\nLately, however, the region has suffered the same troubles bedeviling delis in the east.\nJerry's Famous Deli closed its Costa Mesa branch this spring and laid off dozens of employees. After years spent dishing up pickle-flanked masses of pastrami to the likes of Bruce Willis and Mel Brooks, Junior's closed following a rental spat with its landlord.\n\"There's nothing that can bring back the centrality of the deli in either Jewish life or American life,\" said Ted Merwin, an expert on Jewish culture and a professor at Dickinson College in Pennsylvania. \"There's no way they're going to survive in the numbers they once did.\"\nMerwin thinks Los Angeles' thriving ethnic food scene is partly to blame.\n\"It used to be that delis had a very loyal customer base who would come in every day,\" he said. \"But now, with the restaurant industry in L.A. exploding with thousands and thousands of new options, why would they?\"\nJewish delis are also part of a restaurant sector that has struggled overall since the recession. Sales at family sit-down restaurants stagnated between 2007 and 2011 and grew a stingy 0.5% last year, according to research firm Mintel.\nThe stress showed at Junior's, where revenue slumped 20% over the last three years as food costs surged, the result of unpredictable weather affecting crops and animal feed. Rents are also rising, especially in urban centers, making property difficult to afford for all but the largest chain delis.\nArt's Deli owner Harold Ginsburg, 52, said he's had to cut back on non-food items at the Studio City store: having fewer employees on call, trimming insurance costs and sending delivery cars to the cheapest gas stations.\nAt Langer's, owner Norm Langer jacked up menu prices 4% in March. But the increase \"wasn't enough to compensate for the rising cost of food,\" which he said has soared as much as 9% over the last 18 months.\nFish prices have \"gone crazy,\" said Langer, whose father launched the business 65 years ago. The deli hasn't sold barbecued cod in five years, when the seafood went from being a third cheaper than lox to a third more expensive and supply became unpredictable.\nBeef prices, inflated by the severe summer drought and mass exports to Japan, aren't helping. Neither are skyrocketing premiums for medical benefits for the eatery's unionized workers, Langer said.\nAnd with diners still wary after the downturn, even a pastrami sandwich as revered as his struggles when it costs more than $20 a person after a beverage, a side dish, tax and tip, Langer said.\n\"At Quiznos, you can buy a sandwich for lunch for $5,\" he said. \"That's a third of the cost at a first-class deli. The deli has a better-quality product, but you're going to be filled up with either option.\"\nPart of the problem is younger customers, said David Saul, who with his brother John had inherited Junior's from their father, Marvin.\nThe deli always drew an older crowd, one that grew up eating at diners and other family-centric eateries. But millennials, ages 18 to 34, \"don't understand delis or comfort food\" and are \"used to quick food and instant gratification, going through a drive-thru in 10 seconds,\" Saul said.\nThroughout the restaurant industry, young diners are driving the push toward hip, healthful and sustainable offerings. Delis, known for menus laden with cheesy blintzes and corned beef, have tried to adapt with more low-calorie dishes and local ingredients.\nArt's, which was launched by owner Ginsberg's parents 55 years ago, now sells a \"tremendous amount\" of egg-white omelets and salads to cater to the body-conscious set, he said. Jerry's in West Hollywood has a Louisiana burger, a Korean bibimbap bowl and fettuccine stroganoff on its sprawling menu. Before closing, Junior's added gluten-free rugelach and vegan chopped liver with peas and lentils.\nA menu revamp at Canter's this fall brought in paninis \u2014 including some made with jalape\u00f1o bagels.\n\"You don't have to have just rye bread and pastrami to have a deli sandwich,\" said co-owner Terri Bloomgarden.\nMany say the true Jewish deli renaissance is happening in the Bay Area, where establishments such as Saul's in Berkeley and Wise Sons in San Francisco are experimenting with farm-to-table sourcing and ditching Dr. Brown's celery soda for house-made beverages.\n\"A number of new delis have folded in with the artisanal movement and made the food trendier for the younger generation,\" said David Sax, author of \"Save the Deli.\" \"Hopefully it's the green shoots of a recovery.\"\nOn Feb. 7, the former Junior's space got a second chance when another Jewish deli \u2014 Lenny's \u2014 moved in.\nBut it's not entirely traditional. Owner and serial restaurateur Lenny Rosenberg, whose Holocaust survivor father ran Jewish bakeries in New York, said his eatery features more-healthful options and lower prices to bring the concept \"into the 21st century.\""

        "output": "recent months has been what sectors are displaying leadership qualities. With consumer staples ranking high on that list, some investors, professional and retail, have doubted the viability of the broader market rally.\nInterestingly, a case can be made that this has been a \"risk off\" rally for three years now. Using the nine Select Sector SPDRs as the barometers while going back to March 22, 2010, only one so-called risky ETF has offered noteworthy out-performance of those sector funds that are perceived to have less risk. That ETF is the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLY).\nThe Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR has returned 68.6 percent since March 22, 2010, meaning the ETF has been simply dominant over other sector funds such as the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLB), the Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLF) and the Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLK).\nXLY has easily trumped XLF and XLB over the past 24 months as well. Over that time, XLY has offered better than six times the returns of XLB and almost double the returns of XLK. Remember, XLK had the benefit of having Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) among its top holdings as that stock surged to astronomical heights.\nNot High Beta What may come as a surprise to some investors is that XLY is not extremely volatile despite being home to stocks that are believed to be intimate plays on consumer confidence and sentiment such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS). The ETF has a beta of one against the S&P 500 and annualized volatility of 16.88 percent, according to State Street data.\nThat is a slightly lower beta than what is seen on XLK. Over the past three years, XLY has been about 500 basis points less volatile than XLB and the Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLE), according to ETF Replay data.\nXLE and XLB currently have betas against the S&P 500 of 1.28 and 1.22, respectively.\nNot The Only One With $4.44 billion in assets under management, XLY is the largest discretionary ETF by that metric. It is home to plenty of familiar names and heavily traded with average daily volume of almost 5.5 million shares over the past three months.\nHowever, XLY is not the only generator of noteworthy discretionary ETF returns over the past several years. With a three-year return of 67.6 percent, the Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF (NYSE:VCR) stacks up favorably against the other non-discretionary sector ETFs mentioned here as well as Vanguard&apos;s own lineup of sector funds.\nWhile VCR and XLY are comparable on many levels, cost-conscious investors should keep an eye on this tussle in the coming months because a recent fee reduction by Vanguard means VCR is four basis points cheaper than XLY. That works out to 0.14 percent per year for VCR and 0.18 percent for XLY.\nInvestors that are willing to embrace some added risk can consider the First Trust Consumer Discretionary AlphaDEX Fund (NYSE:FXD). Although FXD has lagged VCR and XLY over the past three years, but the First Trust offering has significantly outpaced other sector funds as well over that time, including energy, materials and technology.\nFXD is not a market cap-weighted ETF. Rather, it uses growth and value metrics to parse through possible constituents. The result is an ETF that looks far different than VCR or XLY in terms of holdings. FXD holds 125 stocks with the top holding being Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) at a weight of just 2.45 percent. Other top-10 holdings include Starz (NASDAQ:STRZA) and Virgin Media (NASDAQ:VMED).\nFXD has been a decent performer over the past year with a gain of 12.2 percent, but some lower risk sector funds such as the Consumer Staples Select SPDR (NYSE:XLP) have delivered better gains. FXD has a three-year standard deviation of 20.4 percent compared to 17.1 percent for the S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary Index, according to First Trust data.\nThat could be viewed as a sign that FXD is better suited to an environment that is more risk on friendly, but it is worth noting FXD has outpaced VCR and XLY year-to-date."

When they also drank, men took in about 400 more daily calories and women about 300 more.\nFor women, the extra calories could be explained by the alcohol alone - but for men, between 100 and 200 were from food.\nThe types of food people ate - not just how much - changed on the days they drank as well. For example, men and women both ate about nine per cent more fat when they drank alcohol, the researchers reported in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.\nMen reported eating more white potatoes and meat on their drinking days and both men and women drank less milk.\nAlthough food choices tended to go in a less-healthy direction on drinking days, 'we can't say that because these people were taking in more calories that they would be gaining weight, because we didn't study that,' Breslow told Reuters Health.\nThe researchers don't know how people ate on the other days of the week, she pointed out, and they might have been compensating for their poor eating habits on drinking days.\n'Why that's happening, it's very hard to speculate based on this,' said Dr Suthat Liangpunsakul, who studies alcohol consumption at the Indiana University School of Medicine in Indianapolis and was not involved in the study.\nLiangpunsakul agreed that it's difficult to determine just how important less-healthy diets on drinking days might be to people's health.\n'We don't know if it will (influence) obesity or weight changes,' he told Reuters Health.\nBreslow said people should be aware that alcoholic beverages add calories and be mindful of how they eat when they drink alcohol, focusing on whole grains, healthy oils and vegetables.

        "output": "Airport.\nA new solar farm would have been too expensive for customers, CU said in a recap of its Thursday board meeting. But CU said it will keep looking at renewable power opportunities for the future.\nCU told the Springfield Business Journal on Friday that 15 energy companies submitted bids for the project, saying they would charge 5 cents to 12 cents per kilowatt-hour of electricity.\nOnly one bidder, Sun Solar, was based in southern Missouri.\nThe proposal was a joint project between the airport and CU, according to previous reporting by the News-Leader.\nIn June, when the airport and CU decided to study whether it made sense to put in a second solar farm, they said the facility would take up 30 acres of land and would add capacity for about 3 more megawatts of energy. They did not set out a timeline for building a second farm.\nAt the time, CU spokesman Joel Alexander said that putting a solar farm near an airport was desirable because airports are \"a gateway to the community.\" Thus, many visitors would be able to see that Springfield is committed to developing more renewable energy.\nThe existing solar farm \u2014 a 40-acre plant just east of Springfield that is owned by North Carolina-based Strata Solar LLC \u2014 was completed in 2014 and has an output of 4.95 megawatts, with 22,000 solar panels. CU owns the land where the farm sits and buys energy produced there.\nIn late December, CU announced that it had contracted with Italy-based Enel Green Power to become one of four utilities buying energy from the $400 million Diamond Vista wind farm located near Salina, Kansas.\nDiamond Vista provides 100 megawatts of electricity to the Springfield area, CU said in a News-Leader report published Dec. 28. With that wind farm added to CU's power-source portfolio, Springfield gets about 40 percent of its energy from renewable sources.\nCU has been working to get more \"green power\" sources into its mix even as demand for electricity is slumping in the United States.\nOn Jan. 24, the federal government posted an expert report outlining projections for energy consumption from 2019 through 2050.\nBased on data models, the feds predict that slow growth in U.S. energy consumption, along with big increases in oil and natural gas production, will change supply and demand such that the United States will start being a net energy exporter in 2020.\nAmerica is expected to continue exporting energy until at least 2050, according to the report.\nNatural gas is expected to have the biggest growth, and its prices are low, so the feds predict continued demand for natural gas power.\nMeanwhile, power companies will shift to more renewable sources over the next 30 years, and more old coal and nuclear power plants are expected to go offline.\nAnother factor in play is that homes, businesses and machines are getting ever more energy-efficient, meaning that overall U.S. energy consumption could stay relatively flat, even as the total economy gets bigger.\nAll that's in keeping with CU's own predictions for Springfield. In March, CU said it expects to see just 1 percent growth in the number of its customers for each year from 2018 to 2022.\nBut electricity use among those roughly 120,000 customers will steadily decline during that time frame, following a trend CU started seeing in 2015.\nDecisions about how much energy is used, and what kinds, are seen as very urgent by scientists and some others due to global increases in temperature that humans have caused in recent centuries.\nIn a report released by the Trump administration over Thanksgiving weekend, federal officials said climate breakdown could cause hundreds of billions of dollars of losses by 2050, and more harm to the U.S. economy by 2100 than was caused by the Great Recession of 2008."

Now, with the fighting over, there were some very messy loose ends whipping in the political winds gusting across East Asia.

It would not be resolved to the full satisfaction of any related party, but would begin an association between the U.S. Armed Forces and South Korea that endures to this day.\nJohn Hodge, a blue-collar native of Golconda, Illinois, had entered the U.S. Army in World War I, rising to the rank of captain, though achieving no great distinction. Between the wars, he served in a variety of infantry regiments and rose through the Army\u2019s staff and war colleges. In June 1942, he was posted to Hawaii. That would be the launch pad from which he would take part in arguably the most murderous combat ever experienced by U.S. fighting men, as they battled from island to island to evict a foe who neither asked for nor gave quarter, and for whom death was preferable to surrender.\nHis battle record is a roll call of Pacific carnage. He served on Guadalcanal then took temporary command of a leaderless division on New Georgia. Next it was divisional command on Bougainville, then command of XXIV Corps on Leyte and Okinawa. By the end of the war, Hodge wore a Legion of Merit, three Distinguished Service Crosses, an Air Medal and a Purple Heart.\nThis was a formidable war record for any officer, but offered little experience in the role Hodge would be playing in Korea \u2015 a role that fell somewhere between statesman, politician, arbitrator, economist, judge and policeman.\nKorea had disappeared from the map in 1910, swallowed whole by Imperial Japan. Korea\u2019s fate had hardly been a priority for the Allies fighting to liquidate the Axis scourge in campaigns that raged from Northwest Europe to the South Pacific and from Southeast Asia to the Russian steppes.\nThough Hitler and Hirohito were allies, Tokyo maintained its April 1941 neutrality pact with the Soviet Union \u2015 even when Stalin was reeling as the Wehrmacht advanced upon Moscow in winter 1941. Had the Japanese abrogated their agreement and invaded the Russian Far East at that time, the U.S.S.R. might well have collapsed, with incalculable ramifications for the rest of the war, and for the world we live in today.\nThe Japanese, however, stayed true to their word, striking against European and American colonies in Southeast Asia instead. Under Allied pressure Stalin agreed to break the pact after the war in Europe was won. On Aug. 9, the Red Army stormed into Manchuria and Korea, traditionally seen as \u201ca dagger pointing at the heart of Japan.\u201d But with the atomic bombs obviating an invasion and with the United States determined to occupy the island nation, Korea suddenly mattered.\nThe Americans suggested the 38th parallel as the halt line for the Soviet offensive. Somewhat to American surprise, the Soviets agreed. By the time Hodge and his men landed, the Soviets had already been in Korea for a month, and a range of provisional Korean government movements had been vying for attention since Aug. 15 (the day Japan formally announced its surrender by radio; the signing did not take place on the Missouri until Sept. 2).\nThe Soviets astutely absorbed the Korea People\u2019s Republic (KPR) \u2015 a loose, national collection of \u201cpeople\u2019s committees\u201d established by Koreans \u2015 into the government that would eventually take shape under Kim Il-sung. In the South, the Americans were not nearly so ready to do business with groups they saw as communist; the people\u2019s committees would be outlawed.\nSo this was one challenge for Hodge: On the international relations front, his task was complicated by the fact that he would be governing just as the Cold War started to heat up. The other challenge was intra-Korean, for various local personalities and factions (understandably) wanted to play a role in their national government, but had been polarized during 35 years of colonization. Come 1945, these individuals and groups had widely differing ideas, aims and agendas.\nPrior to Hodge\u2019s arrival, the Japanese commander in Seoul, Yoshio Kozuki, had already been in touch with the Americans in Japan, warning them of the dangers of communism and suggesting that the Koreans were getting restless. Hodge\u2019s first priorities were law, order and the disarmament and repatriation of Japanese. By the year-end, nearly 400,000 had left; only 1,000 technical employees remained.\nMore difficult was the issue of establishing governance through Koreans. Hodge had to deal with the KPR. His orders from Washington were not to back any government. The KPR \u2015 a left-leaning organization, perhaps, but hardly the communist body the Americans believed it to be, would be banned outright in December.\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Army Military Government in Korea (USAMGIK) was established. Early moves by USAMGIK to hire prominent figures who had served the hated Japanese authorities caused an uproar, but with the only trained civil servants members of the former colonial administration, hostility inevitably set in. Hodge himself, once described the Koreans \u201cthe same breed of cat\u201d as the Japanese, which did not win him any local friends.\nMoreover, the Americans, having dismissed the KPR as a political force, hired heavily from the Korean Democratic Party many of whom spoke English, but the party represented the landlords and wealthier class, and (inevitably) pro-Japanese collaborators. Although USAMGIK did, cut the hated police force by 60 percent, for many ordinary Koreans, looking on, it must have seemed as if they had exchanged one band of occupiers for another.\nMeanwhile, various nationalists were returning home from their long struggles abroad. Syngman Rhee and Kim Ku arrived in, respectively October and November. Neither proved amenable to the U.S. general, partly because of their strong interest in overall peninsula affairs, rather than in the governance of the southern half which he was attempting to administer.\nMeanwhile, a flow of refugees from Manchuria and north of the 38th parallel were swelling the population, while the uncooperative Soviets in the North controlled most of Korea\u2019s power supply. To its credit, USAMGIK curbed a cholera epidemic and overcame food shortages, upgraded educational materials and established labor laws. But it could not resolve increasingly violent politics and had already been accused in the U.S. press of fostering a right-wing police state.\nIn autumn 1946, a strike broke out among railway workers in Busan. It spread to Daegu, then across the south. It was suppressed by the police force and the USAMGIK-established constabulary \u2015 the force which would form the basis of the Republic of Korea Army \u2015 assisted by U.S. advisors. It was a brutal process and it formed a groundswell of anti-USAMGIK and anti-rightist opinion across much of the south. The only place where the people\u2019s committees remained were on Jeju Island \u2015 and their day of reckoning was not far off.\nBut when that happened, the USMGIK era was coming to a close. One of its last acts was a land reform in March 1948, but advised by the landowning classes of the KDP, the reform was only partial. On the global stage, the major powers had failed to reach an agreement on a full Korean plebiscite. U.N.-overseen general elections were carried out in the South on May 10, 1948. The Republic of Korea was established on Aug. 15 with Rhee as president. On Sept. 9, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea was established in the north, with Kim Il-sung as president.\nRhee\u2019s state already had an insurgency on its hands. There had been protests on Jeju Island protesting USAMGIK policy and violence by police and right wing paramilitaries; in April, police posts had been attacked. In September, massive counter-insurgency operations were launched. The end result was perhaps 30,000 islanders killed and over half Jeju\u2019s villages destroyed. In October, further fighting flared in Yeosu as military units rebelled.\nBut this chaos was not for John Hodge to resolve: He had departed Korea on Aug. 27, 1948. Later that same year, the Soviets withdrew their main force troops from Korea; in June 1949, the Americans did the same (though both left behind advisory bodies). With separate nations now established on both sides of the 38th parallel, tensions rose ever higher. Those tensions would explode on June 25, 1950. Troops from across the world would be sucked into the resultant vortex.\nAnd yet it is difficult to say \u2015 with the experience, the guidance and the resources Hodge had at his disposal, and in the Cold War environment in which he was operating \u2015 quite how he could have done a better job. He came; he totally removed the Japanese colonial power apparatus; he stabilized; he administered; he established a government; he left. Much of this was well above his pay grade and he was out of synch on some Washington policies that he was beholden to implement. Yet he did it all within the space of three years, after a 35-year colonial period in which intra-Korean polarities had built up explosive passions, and in an atmosphere of growing international tension.\nHave things improved since? As recent US interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan demonstrate, even with far greater resources than Hodge ever had, and with much more of the Washington brain trust focused thereon than was ever the case with Korea, there is no \u201cright way\u201d to take over and administer a suddenly leaderless nation. The pitfalls are immense.\nJohn Hodge was not the most famous U.S. soldier to command on the peninsula but he was the first American troop commander in Korea \u2015 a sensitive relationship that continues to this day. USAMGIK\u2019s distant descendent, U.S. Forces Korea (USFK), is one of the key components in today\u2019s bilateral relationship.\nObviously, they have been key in keeping the peace since the Korean War, but in an era when only a very few, privileged Koreans could travel abroad \u2015 an era that only came to an end in the early 1990s \u2015 USFK personnel were influential in a different way.\nTheir radio station was a key channel bringing American popular music to Korea, their TV station provided a window on American life and language, and eateries catering to U.S. soldiers, both on- and off-base, were among the first to offer U.S.-style fast food.\nOn the converse, the attitude of arrogant U.S. soldiers, and the drunken and sometimes criminal behavior of GIs have caused friction with local hosts, hosts who have, for most of the post-1945 Korean-American relationship, been very much the junior partners.\nMuch of the latter negativity has ameliorated as USFK\u2019s numbers have dwindled and Korea\u2019s prosperity has risen: While GIs might have looked down on Koreans from the 1950s to the 1980s, they are unlikely to do so today, given this country\u2019s prosperity, sophistication and success. In fact, it would be difficult to think of a better-behaved or more public affairs-conscious overseas garrison than 21st century USFK: GIs in Korea face far more restrictions on their after-hours activities than do other expatriates (or, indeed, Koreans themselves). Moreover, the visibility of GIs has been diluted by the ever-expanding expatriate population.\nYet ironically, the role has become increasingly politicized in their host country, to the extent that USFK is a lightning rod for anti-American sentiment \u2015 a sentiment much on display in 2002.\nNone of this has anything to do with John Hodge, who died in 1963 at the age of 70. He never served in the Korean War, where the most iconic American figure would be his former boss in Japan, MacArthur. Yet as the first commander of U.S. troops in Korea in the post-1945 era, Hodge\u2019s name will continue to be associated with American soldiers on the peninsula until the last \u201cYankee\u201d finally \u201cgoes home.\u201d Given the strategic situation in both Korea and Northeast Asia, that day looks far off."

        "output": "They perpetuate what worked last year. The Status Quo police make sure that happens.\nHierarchies make sure nobody runs off the reservation spending money on crazy, new ideas. \"That's not your problem,\" you hear, or \"The bosses won't go for it,\" or \"That doesn't seem practical or necessary.\" AT&T's hierarchy was able to make sure the company didn't overspend on computer services, network services or cellphones as it carefully maintained its dedication to the sale and delivery of land-line long-distance service. AT&T was acquired by Southwestern Bell when it approached bankruptcy as its revenue growth and profits disappeared.\nCommitment to the company's existing technology, product line, distribution system or customer base becomes a sacred cow. Microsoft's commitment to PC technology has kept it investing in operating system and office automation software for the last decade while losing more than two-thirds of its market share in smartphone operating systems and delaying its entry into the fast-growing tablet business--places where Apple has had astoundingly profitable revenue growth. Dell likewise missed both markets as it kept its focus on its supply-chain strength. Both Microsoft and Dell have stagnated in market capitalization as customers shifted to newer technologies.\nThe status quo police institutionalize initial metrics. They insist that innovations achieve the proper margin, order size or net price or be abandoned--regardless of shifting market demand and potential future growth. Motorola avoided smartphones, seeing them as a small business even if one with higher than traditional margins. Instead the company focused on maintaining its market share targets with its lower-margin sales of ordinary cellphones. Its profits disappeared while Apple soared with an iPhone that had less than 5% market share but a business designed to reap much higher margins. Likewise Digital Equipment focused on its profit margin in computer-aided design and manufacturing software only to be destroyed by its lower margin but higher volume competitor AutoCad.\nSuch destructive norms couldn't be sustained if there weren't people anointed to enforce rigid adherence to them. Those are the Status Quo police. Their job, first and foremost, is to make sure that historical ways of doing business are not altered. It is not to focus on positive business results. To the contrary, it is to make sure the organization stays with the tried and true regardless of results. The police simply assume that results will be good if the status quo continues.\nDoes your human resources department seek to hire \"the right kind of person for our company\"? Does its employee review process focus as much on getting along with peers and supporting cultural norms and supporting the company purpose as on meeting business objectives and getting measurable results? Such HR practices keep a company from hiring, promoting and rewarding people who don't maintain the status quo.\nDoes your finance department review all proposals concerning new products, distributors, manufacturing processes or market entries and comment on whether they meet internal hurdles for gross margin? For net margin? For risk-adjusted return on investment? Does it require detailed financial models for anything new, challenging the numbers for anything outside the most common historical practice? If so, your finance managers are the Status Quo police, keeping the business from doing what may be competitively necessary though frighteningly new.\nDoes your marketing department tightly control what products can carry the company's brand name? Or resist selling through new distribution channels for fear of upsetting old distribution lines? Marketing department managers enforce status quo adherence by making sure they protect old norms first, and they avoid venturing into new products or new ways of distribution regardless of what is happening in the marketplace.\nAt Virgin and Nike the brand means--what? While other record distributors and running shoe companies are now forgotten, Virgin and Nike have grown dramatically by expanding into new businesses far beyond their original arenas of success.\nAmazon's rapid entry into entirely new businesses, including the Kindle and mass merchandising far removed from book sales, has helped it grow and grow. Meanwhile Procter & Gamble has paid the price of focusing on minor brand extensions, seeking approval from the Status Quo police for products like Tide Basic, Charmin Basic and Bounty Basic. Does anybody really consider a less good, cheaper product any way to generate double-digit growth? Sears has lost all growth with its inability to deal with the emergence of traditional retail competitors that have different margin needs and merchandising plans, such as Kohl's , Lowe's and Target , and its inability to embrace Internet retailing as well.\nEarly in their lives, when growth is good, companies form Status Quo police to make sure they keep doing what works well--always the same thing, albeit better, faster and cheaper when possible. They have ultimate faith that this strategy will forever produce profits. They make sure that all resources--people, money, management attention, supplier enhancements--serve that end. No matter how market needs change.\nIn fact, when markets shift, the Status Quo police become an internal gestapo. They make doubly sure change doesn't happen. Deteriorating results are beside the point. Realignment with markets, re-establishing growth and improving profitability cannot begin until somebody removes those Status Quo police from power. Only then can innovation and organizational creativity re-emerge to successfully focus on results and take the company forward.\nAdam Hartung lives in Chicago and is a partner in Vector Growth Partners, a growth strategy consulting firm in suburban Washington, D.C.

        "output": "shootings and carjackings from the escalating drug war don't exactly build confidence for a family planning a week's holiday. And on April 22, the U.S. State Department upgraded its travel warnings to target 14 of Mexico's 31 states.\nNow's not the time to visit our southerly neighbor, right? Well, wrong. Mexico is a lot safer than you may realize.\nWe tend to lump all of Mexico -- a country the size of Western Europe -- together. For example, a border incident resulted in the death of a Colorado tourist last year, and the Texas Department of Homeland Security recommended against travel to all of Mexico.\nYet it's in the 17 of 31 states not named in the newly expanded warnings where you'll find the most rewarding destinations: the Yucatan Peninsula and Baja California beach resorts, colonial hill towns like the ex-pat haven of San Miguel de Allende, even the capital Mexico City.\nAn hour inland from Cancun's beaches, Yucatan state -- home to the most popular Mayan sites and \"real Mexican\" colonial cities such as Merida and Valladolid -- is among the country's safest. The state, with roughly the same population as Kansas, saw two drug-related deaths in 2010. Wichita, Kansas, alone had six gang-related killings over the same period.\nIn most of central and southern Mexico, drug violence simply isn't on the radar of daily life. \"It's as easy-going as it's always been,\" said Deborah Felixson, a diving operator on Cozumel who is \"shocked\" when people say they had been scared to go to the Caribbean island. \"We're just small communities here. We all know what everyone's up to.\"\nThat sentiment is found even in places once linked with political tension, such as Chiapas state and Oaxaca City, where political protest turned into a stand-off in 2006.\n\"Things are so much quieter now,\" said Rogelio Vallesteros, who runs a Spanish-language school in Oaxaca City. \"People call to ask about safety all the time, then they come and see how quiet it is. We're normal, really.\"\nAfter the swine-flu crisis of 2009 -- when some cruise ships diverted routes from Mexican ports that had no reported cases to American ones that did -- travel bounced back a bit last year. Interestingly, the increase of returning Canadians and many Western Europeans doubled that of the American rate. We seem to remain particularly leery of Mexico.\nThat's sad. My love of travel began with childhood visits to Mexican ruins and beaches, and I feel the U.S. is fortunate, not cursed, to be so close to a place that offers jungles, deserts, volcanoes, beaches, coral reefs, ancient pyramids, living pre-European cultures and some of the world's most satisfying cuisines.\nAnd of course the best reason to go: the people.\nA couple years ago, I informally polled various innkeepers and tour operators worldwide to find out who are the world's friendliest travelers. Guess who won. \"Mexicans are such a joy to have here,\" one Bulgarian guesthouse owner e-mailed back. \"They make everyone feel happier.\"\nAnd it's often better in Mexico, where locals show particular gusto in love of life. Once I saw fireworks go off in Mexico City, before sunset, and asked a local why. He was surprised I didn't know. \"It's Friday,\" he explained.\nIn restaurants, strangers seeing each other's eyes instinctively say \"buen provecho\" before eating. It's an earnest wish that their food should not only be tasty, but really pleasurable, and that the hope that their life will be a bit better as a result. There really is no English equivalent. Even our adopted \"bon app\u00e9tit\" pales in significance.\nNaturally, crime exists everywhere in Mexico.\nI've been pickpocketed in Guadalajara (and in New York, too). But that's the extent of my unpleasant scrapes in a dozen visits that have taken me to home-stay language courses, traditional Mayan markets, mummy museums, cenotes (surreal limestone sinkholes in which you can swim) and even Zapatista zones in the south.\nMost travel to Mexico, ultimately, is simply good travel. It's fun, affordable, eye-opening and fascinating (seriously, what other city of 21 million other than Mexico City is founded on a filled-in lake?).\nBut, no, you don't have to visit Mexico. And there are certainly places, like Ciudad Juarez or Tamaulipas state, I'd never visit now. Just know that the Mexico experienced on the ground almost never matches the Mexico we increasingly see and read about."

As Tehran tries to offset the squeeze from Western oil sanctions, there is no greater priority than courting energy-hungry Asian markets.\nThe planned visit by Manmohan",
        "output": "Singh, the first by an Indian prime minister in more than a decade, puts into sharp relief the sanctions-easing strategies by Iran \u2014 and the political complexities for Washington that limit its pressure on Asian powers needing Tehran&apos;s oil.\nOil purchases by India, China and South Korea \u2014 which decided this week to resume Iranian imports \u2014 have not covered Tehran&apos;s losses after it was tossed out of the European market in July. But they have given Iran a critical cushion that brings in tens of millions of dollars in revenue a day and means that Iran has dropped only one ranking, to stand as OPEC&apos;s third-largest producer.\nThe U.S. has pressed hard for Iran&apos;s top customers \u2014 China, India, Japan and South Korea \u2014 to scale back on crude imports, with some success, offering in return exemptions from possible American penalties. But Washington cannot push its key Asian trading partners too fast or too aggressively and risk economic rifts.\n\"Despite Western sanctions ... China and Japan will remain major importers of Iranian crude oil and so will India,\" said Siddak Bakir, a Middle East and South Asian analyst for IHS Energy in London.\nThe ability of sanctions to wring concessions over Iran&apos;s nuclear program remains a key divide between Israel and the U.S. and its European partners.\nWashington urges allowing more time for sanctions to eat into Iran&apos;s economy, which depends on oil exports for 80 percent of its foreign revenue. Some Israeli leaders have indicated a military attack is a possibility if they conclude the international community has failed to halt Iran&apos;s uranium enrichment. Iran insists it&apos;s not seeking atomic weapons and its reactors are for energy and medical use.\nFor Iran, however, there&apos;s a parallel fight: Trying to keep the oil flowing to its key Asian customers, possibly through deals to sell at below-market prices.\n\"China and India are not doing this as a favor to Iran. Quite the contrary,\" said Pennsylvania-based oil trader Stephen Schork. \"I am sure they are extracting a very good deal out of the Iranians. ... I don&apos;t think it&apos;s fair to say Iran is unscathed. Certainly, they are under duress.\"\nAt the same time, the U.S. is applying relentless pressure on Iran&apos;s big oil markets to cut back on Iranian imports. Published and anecdotal data suggest some headway by Washington, which sweetened the offer by granting the big-four Asian buyers exemptions from possible penalties in return for curbing Iranian imports.\nOn Wednesday, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the exemptions would be reviewed at the end of their six-month term. \"What&apos;s important to us is ... that the net flow is continuing to decrease,\" she told reporters in Washington.\nStill, it&apos;s clear the U.S. is unwilling to risk trade wars with key Asian trading partners, even over the showdown with Iran.\n\"The U.S. needs Asia. It needs to maintain good relations. It also needs Asia as a critical partner in its efforts to pressure Iran through sanctions,\" said Sami al-Faraj, director of the Kuwait Center for Strategic Studies. \"It&apos;s a delicate process of diplomacy, incentives and alternatives.\"\nEven fast-growing China \u2014 which counts on Iran for about 10 percent of its energy needs \u2014 has slightly scaled back on imports from Iran: 510,000 barrels a day in the second quarter this year, compared with 560,000 in the same period last year. But some analysts say this was more over a pricing dispute than U.S. pressure.\nOn Tuesday, South Korea said it would resume buying Iranian oil in September after a two-month break, but at reduced levels that comply with U.S. sanctions guidelines.\nCutting Iranian crude was just too big a price for South Korea, which has nearly 3,000 companies that sold $6 billion worth of goods to Iran in 2011. Iran was also the only country that supplied oil to South Korea during the 1973 oil crisis and, in return, a major downtown street in Seoul was named after the Iranian capital, Tehran.\n\"South Korea does not want its ties with Tehran to irk the U.S., so it made great efforts to persuade the Obama administration to give it an exemption. Iran is probably the most important Middle Eastern country for South Korea, and it is very difficult for South Korea to sever its ties with Iran because it offers cheaper oil,\" said Chang Byung-ock, an Iran expert at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul.\nThe 27-nation EU accounted for 18 percent of Iran&apos;s exports, or about 450,000 barrels a day. Add that to the reductions in Asia \u2014 more than half of Iran&apos;s oil exports before the EU sanctions \u2014 and Iran has lost a significant, but not yet crippling, portion of its oil revenue.\nAccording to the International Energy Agency, a 28-nation group that monitors global energy trends, Iran&apos;s crude oil production has fallen steadily since May to 2.9 million barrels a day in July, dropping Iran to the No. 3 spot behind resurgent Iraq.\nMeanwhile, imports of Iranian oil by major consumers plunged to 1 million barrels a day in July from 1.74 million barrels a day in June, according to an Aug. 10 report from the agency, which did not give a country-by-country breakdown.\nIn late July \u2014 about a month after the EU halted Iranian oil purchases \u2014 Iran&apos;s central bank chief, Mahmoud Bahmani, called Western sanctions akin to a \"military war\" that requires new economic countermeasures in return. These likely will include boosting sales of petrochemical products, such as motor oil, that are not covered by sanctions, as well as expansive diplomatic efforts to secure oil markets in China and India.\nThe latter is set to take center stage with the Indian prime minister&apos;s appearance at the Aug. 30-31 meeting in Tehran of the Non-Aligned Movement, a Cold War relic that Iran seeks to rebuild as a counterpoint to Western influence.\nIndia has faced a full-scale press from both sides.\nIn May, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton stopped in India and made repeated appeals for Iran&apos;s No. 2 oil customer to scale back on its purchases. India has curbed some of its Iranian imports \u2014 agreeing after Clinton&apos;s visit to an 11 percent drop in the coming year. But there are limits to how far India can go as it struggles with a widening deficit and weak rupee, which drives up the costs of oil imports.\nIndia has joined Japan in offering government-backed insurance for ships carrying Iranian crude, to bypass European sanctions that prohibit EU companies from offering coverage. The move seeks to avoid interruptions in the Iranian oil supply, with the first shipment by a government-insured tanker scheduled to arrive in India this week.\nJapan was the first country to devise a workaround to the EU sanctions, passing the emergency measure in late June to avoid a disruption in critical oil supplies due to actions against Iran.\nAny potential economic lifelines for Iran are likely to feed into calls by Israelis favoring a military strike on Iran. At the same time, opponents of military action have become increasingly outspoken as signs point to a war footing, such as the opening of new gas mask distribution centers in the Jewish state.\n\"Iran tries to present an image of having some kind of network of relationships with outside countries, and say they are not as vulnerable,\" said Eldad Pardo, an Iranian affairs expert at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. \"But the facts on the ground show they are under a lot of pressure.\"\nAssociated Press writers Pamela Sampson and Vijay Joshi in Bangkok, Erika Kinetz in New Delhi, Blake Sobczak in Jerusalem and Matthew Lee in Washington contributed to this report."

        "output": "April, requires all physicians in the state who perform abortions to have staff privileges at a local hospital.\nAbortion clinic officials in Montgomery, Birmingham, and Mobile say they cannot comply with the requirement.\nLawyers say the new measure is a pretext to prevent abortions in Alabama. A similar provision that would have shut down the only abortion provider in Mississippi was recently blocked by a federal judge in that state.\n\u201cThe purpose and effect of the requirement, which is wholly unnecessary and unreasonable, is to impose a substantial obstacle in the path of women seeking abortion prior to viability,\u201d the Alabama complaint says.\n\u201cIt is an unreasonable health regulation, and it has the unlawful purpose and effect of imposing an undue burden on women\u2019s right to choose abortion,\u201d the lawsuit says.\nBut Alexa Kolbi-Molinas, a staff attorney with the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, calls it part of national strategy by antiabortion activists to exploit novel ways to shut down abortion clinics at the state level.\n\u201cWe are in court to protect a woman\u2019s ability to make her own personal, private health care decisions,\u201d the president of Planned Parenthood Southeast, Staci Fox, said in a statement.\nHospital staff privileges can be difficult for an abortion provider to obtain, Ms. Kolbi-Molinas said, because they are generally reserved for physicians who regularly admit patients to the hospital. She said the designation requires that the doctor admit 12 to 48 patients a year.\nAbortion is such a safe procedure, she said, that there is no way an abortion provider could come close to meeting such a requirement.\nIn the few cases that do require emergency treatment, the patient should be permitted to receive medical attention at the closest hospital to the patient without requiring the presence of the doctor who performed the abortion, the lawyer said.\nThe complaint says that some abortion providers might be denied staff privileges because of a hospital\u2019s religious opposition to abortion. Some require the doctor to reside close enough to the hospital to be available on call, and university hospitals require physicians to obtain a faculty appointment prior to gaining staff privileges.\nThe 14-page complaint was filed in federal court in Montgomery, Ala. It says that if the law shut down abortion clinics in the state\u2019s three major cities, only two other clinics would remain open in Alabama \u2013 in Huntsville and Tuscaloosa.\n\u201cIf the staff privileges requirement takes effect, women in Montgomery, Birmingham, and all points south would be forced to travel at least 100 miles, and some more than 200 miles \u2026 to obtain an abortion in the state,\u201d the suit says.\nIt adds that most women would have to make the trip twice, first for counseling, and second, at least 24 hours later, for the abortion.\nOther similarly situated health-care providers are not required to have staff privileges at a local hospital, the suit says.\nThe lawsuit names Gov. Robert Bentley and Attorney General Luther Strange as defendants. Also named are the district attorneys in Montgomery County, Jefferson County, Mobile County, and four state health officials.\nThe case is Planned Parenthood v. Bentley."

That was the score at the interval.\nT&T came out intent on a knockout in the second half. Almost straight from the kickoff, Ng Wai and Shade set up camp on the edge of Grenada\u0092s 18 yard box.

Scrupulously nonpartisan, intellectually honest, genuinely serious about government and about ideas, National Journal has always been a publication that everyone in D.C. could trust.\nThose are the essential values that we",
        "output": "wanted to take forward into the new National Journal. But we also knew that a lot about the magazine had to change. So many of the things that National Journal's print magazine was long known for are now being done on our highly successful website \u2014 in greater volume and with greater speed than the magazine ever could have managed.\nYet we didn't, and don't, think the Internet has made print obsolete. It has simply challenged magazine editors to ask themselves: What is print still for?\n(Harry Campbell)We've come up with a few answers to that question. A print magazine, we believe, is for narrative writing that is beautifully crafted and deeply reported. It's for journalism that takes big ideas seriously. It's for long pieces that feel short because they're truly fun to read. It's for telling stories that are complicated and nuanced \u2014 as almost all stories worth knowing are. It's for describing the characters, famous or unknown, who shape American democracy \u2014 and for understanding their agendas, their motivations, their flaws, their strengths. It's for publishing established, brilliant writers, and also for discovering the next generation of storytelling stars.\nFinally, we believe that essential to the experience of reading a great print magazine is a beautiful design \u2014 elegant fonts, striking illustrations, excellent photography. Joseph Heroun brilliantly reconceived the magazine's overall look and created the stunning designs that fill the pages of our first issue. At the same time, we also wanted to reimagine how we present our magazine pieces online. Jenny Mazer did a fantastic job of devising an eye-catching new digital format for these pieces.\nThere are plenty of magazines that use the approach to journalism we are now emphasizing \u2014 that focus on long-form writing and great storytelling and outstanding art. But there are no magazines that use this approach to relentlessly focus on the world of policy and politics \u2014 and that are broadly trusted across the political spectrum. That is the kind of publication we aim to produce.\nTo produce a terrific magazine 32 times a year will be no easy task, but we are lucky to have some of the best magazine minds in the business steering the ship \u2014 especially our deputy editor, Andie Coller, and our managing editor, Amanda Cormier. All of us are looking forward to creating the new National Journal week after week for our members and subscribers. The magazine we are building is one that we think Washington needs. More than anything, we hope it's a magazine you enjoy.\nRichard Just is the editor of National Journal magazine. He was formerly the editor of The New Republic, which he led to a National Magazine Award nomination for general excellence in the thought-leader magazine category in 2012\"\u201dTNR's first nomination for general excellence in 20 years.

        "output": "deployed by online banking, retailers and, increasingly, consumer web services.\nGoogle, Facebook, Dropbox and Tumblr have all implemented forward secrecy already, and LinkedIn is understood to be introducing it in 2014.\nUsers may not immediately notice any difference, other than a barely perceptible time lag as they use the service across desktop, mobile and through third party services, but for Twitter the move asserts its credentials as a company fiercely protective of its users' data.\nThat data includes not only messages that users choose to publish publicly, but also direct, private messages, protected tweets and data on what users say, who they comment on and who else they read. Collectively, large datasets, such as those of Twitter's 218 million users, can be analysed to identify connections between people, locations and interests.\nAnnouncing the new implementation, which has been running as a trial since 21 October, a detailed post on Twitter's engineering blog encouraged other sites to \"defend and protect the users' voice\" by implementing HTTPS and forward secrecy.\nDocuments released by Edward Snowden, a former contractor to the US National Security Agency, have shown that the agency and its affiliates are storing vast amounts of encrypted consumer data so that it can later attempt to decrypt it, either by accessing unencrypted data or by using specific court orders to force data owners to hand over the private SSL keys. But forward secrecy means that data would still be secure, even if the agency obtained the keys to the encrypted data.\nFirst developed in 1992, perfect forward secrecy creates a new, disposable key for each exchange of information, which means the key for every individual session would have to be decrypted to access the data.\nTwitter engineer Jacob Hoffman-Andrews said that implementation on Twitter was complex because of its scale, which meant that extra work was done to ensure the process did not slow the site. He wants to encourage smaller sites to introduce forward secrecy and said it could take as little as two weeks to implement. \"We are trying to create a new norm for what it means to be a secure website,\" he said. \"It makes it harder for anyone attempting a large-scale cryptographic attack, but this is not just about the NSA. There's more than one apex predator on the internet, including terrorists and groups outside of government \u2013 anyone well-funded could use the same techniques.\"\nFellow engineer Jeff Hodges said Twitter's policy of asserting its users' right to privacy marked it out from other services, and that the Snowden revelations had a big impact inside the company. \"It was a big surprise, and it inspired a lot of work,\" he said. \"There's a gap to be bridged between what developers know to be the correct thing to do next, and that becoming policy at companies so that they invest the time to make it happen. But that process is percolating up.\"\nChester Wisniewski, senior security advisor at software security firm Sophos, said that several mainstream consumer sites have moved to improve security of user data in the wake of the Snowden revelations, but doubted that the move was due to consumer demand.\n\"The people working on the next generation of web standards are considering making encryption of all web traffic the default,\" he said. \"Most of the movement towards improved security and privacy is long overdue. For a couple of years now, Google redesigned parts of its networks to offer HTTPS encryption for all of its services, and Yahoo! announced it will begin using [the secure protocol] HTTPS everywhere they can from 2014. The public pressure is welcomed by those of us who are concerned about the privacy of the average individual. It is simply unfortunate that it took a leak like this for companies to do the right thing.\""

The city agreed that Lighthouse can locate in the commercial space that it had previously been refused permission to occupy. Additionally, the city agreed to amend its zoning code to remove the distinction between secular and religious assemblies. The city also agreed to allow all public assemblies in the city's commercial areas and will pay attorney's fees and costs to Liberty Counsel.\nUntil this past summer, Lighthouse was located in a nearby town in a small building with no sewer or running water. The church outgrew the facility and then secured an opportunity to lease within Titusville's C-1 commercial zone. The local zoning code did not allow churches, but permitted theaters, clubs, lodges, bars and amusements in its commercial areas. Lighthouse was forced outside the city of Titusville, where they rented a temporary building that lacks heat and insulation.

The general caveats apply: in smaller samples of games, teams have disparate strength of schedules and may be uniquely impacted by shorter-term injuries and the like. I have isolated to the 19 teams that are fighting for 16 spots.\nLet\u2019s start by just isolating for even strength play first. Here, you have each team\u2019s performance by three measures \u2013 the percentage of goals in their favour (x axis), the percentage of shots in their favour (y axis), and the points they have accumulated per-game (size of the bubble).\nA few of the Canadian teams stand out here for some obvious reasons.\nToronto is also noteworthy because for all of the guffawing about how bad this team is playing right now, everything is graded on a relative basis.\nLet\u2019s be clear: there should be little pride in comeback wins against the Flyers, let alone getting throttled by the 31st-place Ottawa Senators. But even their roughest stretch of hockey sees them breaking even in shots and goals at 5-on-5, and it sounds like, absent Jake Gardiner, they\u2019re going to get some injury relief here in short order. So no, Toronto isn\u2019t playing well relative to most contenders. They are playing well enough to sustain the conversation about chasing the two seed in the Atlantic Division, though even that appears fleeting.\nLastly, there\u2019s Calgary. The Flames have been terrifying all season long and have routinely skated most teams out of the rink, be it at the Scotiabank Saddledome or elsewhere. We can still use this as a weekly reminder about how critical it is for the Flames to win the Pacific.\nThere are only a couple of other teams who appear comparably dominant in the most critical game state, and one just so happens to be that gigantic bubble over to the right in the form of the Vegas Golden Knights. Since the trade deadline, the Knights have doubled up their opponents in goals, are more than 100 shots in the black over a span of eight games, and have just one loss on the ledger. That loss came against Calgary on a back-to-back with a backup goaltender. So, yeah. Win the Pacific, Calgary!\nNow, let\u2019s run through the same performance measures but including all situations data. This will be a bit choppier due to disparities in special-teams opportunities but it does well descriptively to explain why teams are moving up and down in the standings.\nI mentioned Montreal\u2019s power play earlier. Their position on the graph really didn\u2019t change, but I would be remiss to point out that there is an underlying theme here about the Canadiens and their power play. Montreal\u2019s reality is that their power play, by and large, will be the reason they miss the postseason if it comes to that.\nSince the deadline Montreal has one power-play goal in nearly 50 minutes of hockey, which is 30th in the NHL over that span. It\u2019s something this team has dealt with all season long, and it\u2019s rearing its ugly head at the most critical point of the regular season.\nAn average power play this season is scoring a little over seven goals per 60 minutes of hockey, or converting on about 20 per cent of their power-play opportunities. Montreal season-to-date: 4.2 goals per 60 minutes of hockey and converting on fewer than 12 per cent of their power play opportunities. Just maintaining an average man advantage in Montreal would have seen them gain 18 goals in the standings, which is worth approximately three wins.\nHow critical is three wins? On Sunday, the Canadiens were four and three points back of the two wild-card slots, respectively. I\u2019ll let you do the rest of the math."

The defendants have stated that The Pirate Bay is a legal site containing a collection of Internet links, but the entertainment industry sees it differently.\nA tracker doesn't host the files for download itself, but instead carries \"torrent\" files that point file-sharing applications such as BitTorrent to other computers that contain parts of the file to be downloaded.The original verdict against the three was handed down in April last year, and sentenced Neij, Sunde, Lundstr\u00f6m and a fourth defendant, Gottfrid Svartholm Warg to one year in prison.\nAlso, the court has found that some acts that the prosecutor has claimed to be part of an illegal activity have not been proved. Others are not punishable, according to the court. For example, the court has found that Sunde's role as The Pirate Bay's spokesman doesn't constitute a criminal offense. Sweden's freedom of press protection also includes a freedom to make statements to the press, it said.\nLundstr\u00f6m's sentence was reduced because there wasn't enough proof for the allegation that he was a party of a contract according to which an external host owner was guaranteed a certain share of the profits.\nStill, the entertainment industry seems to be content with the verdict.\nThe most important thing is that the defendants have been found guilty in the Court of Appeals as well, said Peter Danowsky, the lawyer who has represented the music industry. The verdict comes as relief, he said.\nThe defendants are understandably not as happy, and they are ready for another round.\n\"There will be an appeal to the supreme court, don't worry,\" Sunde said in a Twitter message.\nThe appeals trial took place in September and October, but Svartholm Warg was unable to take part due to illness, and will get a separate trial for which the dates will now be decided, according to judge Kristina Boutz.Since the original verdict, the entertainment industry's lawyers have done their best to shut down the site, asking courts around the world to force Internet service providers to block access to the site for their customers.\nThe tactic has seen some success: users in Denmark can't access the site.\nThe defendants say they are no longer involved with The Pirate Bay, but it's still seen as the place to go to find the latest TV shows, movies and music. On Friday morning, the site had about 4.8 million registered users and 3.2 million torrents. The eighth episode from the seventh season of House was the most popular TV show and Inception was the most popular movie."

Five of the top players returning were freshmen a year ago.\nHere are 18 players to watch entering the 2018-19 boys basketball season, listed in alphabetical order by last name.\nOne of two seniors that started as freshmen, Brenneke averaged 8.8 points, 3.2 rebounds, 2.8 assists and 1.5 steals per game for the Cardinals.\nThe Tri-Village senior averaged about 13 points per game off the bench.\nFrye didn't start playing basketball until he was 14 years old, but he credits Rick Wedlow for instilling in him the passion for the game. Head coach Shabaz Khaliq appreciates Frye's desire to get better, and as a senior, Frye will have his biggest role yet. Frye's 3.6 rebounds per game are the most among returning Red Devils, and he only averaged 2.1 points. But again, stats aren't his biggest contribution to the team.\nHarrison averaged 15.6 points per game and was named to the All-Cross County Conference team, as National Trail went 15-9 for their first winning season since 2005. Harrison had a school-record 69 3-pointers, shooting 43 percent from the 3-point line, 54 percent from the field and 82 percent from the free-throw line.\nHillard was part of a very successful run at Northeastern, including averaging 9.8 points, 3.4 assists and 1.2 steals per game as a junior. He transferred to Richmond when his father, Shane, took over as Richmond\u2019s girls basketball coach following the death of former head coach Casey Pohlenz.\nKroft showed some of what he can do when he threw down a dunk during the scrimmage on Saturday, and like his brother, has the makeup to one day be a Division I basketball player.\nKroft instantly makes Richmond better. Just days after transferring to Richmond, he announced his verbal commitment to Ball State University and has since signed. Kroft averaged 12 points per game during his junior season at Fort Wayne North, and led Richmond with 29 points during Saturday\u2019s scrimmage against Franklin Central.\nLumpkin played in all 26 games as a freshman, averaging 8.1 points, 2.7 rebounds and 2.4 assists per game as a freshman for the Knights, one of the most consistent programs in the past decade.\nMoynihan averaged a near double-double as a freshman, as Seton advanced to the regional championship game for the first time in school history.\nMoynihan chipped in 9.6 points, 9.7 rebounds, 1.1 assists and 3.4 blocked shots per game, had 10 double doubles and a triple double.\nThe other three-year starter, Reichley averaged 9.5 points, 5.3 rebounds, 1.5 assists and 2.2 steals per game. He and Moynihan tied for team-highs with 31 made 3-pointers.\nThe 6-foot-7 Sparks played in 17 games as a freshman, averaging 5.2 points and 6.4 rebounds per game.\nSwimm averaged 11.5 points per game a year ago, the most among returning players. A three-sport standout, Swimm enters the season as a leading contender for the TEC Player of the Year honors. He also averaged 3.6 rebounds, 1.2 assists just under a steal per game for the 15-8 Tigers.\nTorres averaged 7.6 points, 2.1 assists, 2.6 rebounds and 1.4 steals per game for the Wayne County champions.\nVanlandingham was another freshman that played in all 26 games for the Knights, and his career-high 20 points against Centerville helped the Knights advance to the sectional championship game.\nWissel averaged 10.4 points, 7.9 rebounds, 1.3 assists and 1.8 steals per game for the Rebels."

        "output": "a loose-ball rebound and fired up and nailed a shot from the 3-point area on the right side that just beat the buzzer, but was ruled a two-point basket, allowing the visiting Tornadoes to escape the Quaker gym with a thrilling 35-34 victory.\nJust like the first game between the two schools \u2013 a 43-40 win by the Quakers last month \u2013 the leads by either team never were very big all night and the teams played tremendous defense on every possession.\nThe win gives the Tornadoes (17-2 overall) a record of 11-1 in the East Central Ohio League and a one-game lead on the Quakers (15-2, 10-2) with two league games left for each.\nDover also snapped New Phila\u2019s 14-game winning streak, picked up its eighth straight win and gave Von Kaenel \u2013 already the winningest high school coach in Tuscarawas County history \u2013 another milestone win.\nVon Kaenel now has won 500 games at Dover.\nAnd he and everyone else in the gym won\u2019t soon forget this one, either.\nBoth teams seemed to respond time and again on Friday. Dover took the early lead and was up 11-8 after the first quarter on the strength of seven points from senior Ethan Snyder, but the Quakers tied it up by halftime at 18-18 with junior Jent Joseph scoring nine of New Phila\u2019s points in the half.\nNew Phila actually had an opportunity to have a nice lead at the break, but made only two of seven free throws in the first and second quarters, and finished a tough 12 of 22 from the line for the game.\nDover appeared ready to take over the game in the third quarter, as Snyder drained a 3-pointer and junior Kade Ruegsegger added two free throws to put the Tornadoes up 23-20. But after a basket by New Phila\u2019s Nate Voll pulled the Quakers to within 23-20, a Dover player lost his composure, was whistled for a foul and a quick technical foul, and the Quakers ended up making four of six free throws on the possession to take a 24-23 lead into the fourth quarter.\nDover\u2019s Jules Freeman promptly gave the Tornadoes the lead back on a 3-pointer early in the fourth quarter and the fight to the finish was on from there.\nNew Phila\u2019s Noah Begue gave the Quakers a 30-29 lead with 3:55 left on two free throws before Ruegsegger got loose for a layup out of an inbounds play and Dover\u2019s Ian Sexton canned two free throws to put the Tornadoes up 33-30 with 1:24 remaining. Joseph made two free throws to make it 33-32 with 36.2 seconds left and Ruegsegger added a free throw for a 34-32 Dover lead with 13.8 seconds left.\nAfter a New Phila turnover on a charge call, Folkert made one free throw for the 35-32 Dover lead.\nThe Quakers came right up the floor and got a good 3-point shot attempt that bounced away from the crowd around the basket and out toward Weekley just above the right corner. He stepped right into the ball and let the shot fly and when it went in the gym went absolutely bonkers until the officials ruled it was a two-point basket and ran off the floor.\n\u201cThese are two such evenly matched teams \u2013 it was just a battle right from the start,\u201d Von Kaenel said.\nThe teams both struggled shooting the ball due to the intense defense, as Dover made only 12 of 41 (29.2 percent) and New Phila made 10 of 27 (37 percent).\nSnyder led Dover with 12 points and Ruegsegger had 10. Joseph was the only Quaker in double figures with 15 points, while Begue (4 points before fouling out) and Voll (3 points) combined for seven.\nThe Tornadoes also had a big 33-20 rebounding advantage, including grabbing 14 offensive rebounds."

Aaron Gordon (23 points, 10 rebounds, seven assists) led six players in double figures. Terrence Ross (16 points) was lethal off the bench.\n\"It's unacceptable,\" Collison said. \"We can't lose a game like that, especially at home, when everything is going our way most of the game.

Playing at home and letting them score 120 points makes it impossible to win the game. ... We didn't have our defense like we did last night.\"\nMyles Turner (16 points, 12 rebounds) battled Nic Vucevic (19 points) for post position, forcing him to take difficult shots to help Indiana extend a 57-56 halftime lead.\nRoss then got hot, much like he did in scoring 30 and 23 in previous wins vs. Indiana, with four 3s though he only made 5 of 14 shots overall.\nTyreke Evans (seven points) was the opposite off the bench for the Pacers. He routinely took the ball into traffic and missed Doug McDermott (10 points) spotting up wide open in transition during a pivotal stretch of the fourth with his team in desperate need of a bucket.\nThaddeus Young (10 points) and Wesley Matthews (13 points) were called for fouls on what appeared to be a clean steal and block late in the fourth to compound the Pacers' woes.\nThe hole they'd put themselves in, however, meant it probably wouldn't have mattered.\nAllowing this many points in regulation isn't how they've gotten this far.\n\"In the second half, teams are able to get to another level and raise their energy and intensity,\" McMillan said. \"We are not able to do that.\"\nIt's a good time to decompress."

However, one reason the firm is seeing a backlash is because most of the bloggers chosen for the program were already McDonald's fans.\nIn 2010, McDonald's held a campaign for 15 bloggers, inviting all of them and their families to the company's headquarters in Illinois and paying for everything from food to car rides to the hotel stay. Some critics said the trip was a way of getting the bloggers to write positive stories about the company, but Rick Wion, director of social media for McDonald's USA, told The New York Times that bloggers \u201care key influencers\u201d for the brand.\n\u201cWe need to make sure we're working with them,\u201d he said.\nMany companies take bloggers on trips or send them gifts, so McDonald's shouldn't be the only brand in the spotlight for these activities. In October 2011, CGPR helped Agron, Adidas' exclusive distributor of its outdoor sports division, select 12 bloggers for a trip to Adidas' global headquarters and testing facilities in Herzogenaurach, Germany. Pampers has also interacted with bloggers and other consumers by helping them throw in-home baby shower-themed parties with its products.\nWhile bloggers are often viewed as members of the media, they don't have to follow the same rules that many journalists do, so they can accept as many gifts and trips as they want.\nIt seems like McDonald's is just joining the bandwagon on blogger events and campaigns. As long as the company remains transparent about the initiatives and what they entail, criticism will most likely taper out.\nCorrection: An earlier version of the story described McDonald's blogger initiative incorrectly.

But critics predict the commission won't get far, given that Saudi officials have more or less operated with impunity since the kingdom was founded less than a century ago.\nMOHAMMED FAHAD AL QAHTANI: This is like a Soviet-style economy, that things are run in hierarchy and it's prone to corruption, so corruption is really intrinsic.\nSARHADDI NELSON: Mohammed Fahad al Qahtani heads the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association based in Riyadh.\nFAHAD AL QAHTANI: So it's not really a normal, you know, administrative or financial corruption that you may see in other countries. This is a political corruption and the solution requires a political solution, political reform. And they are not willing to do it.\nSARHADDI NELSON: There were no measures changing the power structure in the March decrees from King Abdullah. The Saudi government also chose to ignore demands from domestic and international human rights groups for the release of political prisoners. Qahtani believes that's a mistake. His organization has called on the king to create a constitutional monarchy in Saudi Arabia, with parliamentary elections and ministries run by commoners.\nFAHAD AL QAHTANI: We are not really calling for toppling the royal family, but they must reform. I mean this kind of absolute monarchy is really out of time, this like medieval political structure is really out of time. That we live in this day and age where revolution is roaring throughout the Middle East and you want to hold and maintain the status quo?

Elavarasan wants Wleh to toe the line when he joins the rest of the team for pre-season next week.\n\u201cI expect nothing less than full commitment from Patrick in the coming season. No more self-marketing or using PKNS as a stepping stone for better offers. The team\u2019s needs must come first at all times,\u201d warned Elavarasan.\nThe Liberian international is one of three players offered new contracts by the Selangor-based club side.

        "output": "I don't know the answers to questions like this. I do however... know how to show up for a fight.\nFor those looking for actual guidance, I do know more than that. Environments like this hurt. We all know that the central bank has caused a lot of harm to both the economy as well as the marketplace. I have warned on that for months. Now, that is the condition. We can not look to the committee for help. They are not doing their homework. In addition, the probability of an escalation in the trade war with China is now being more fully priced into the tech sector, and even names with nearly no overseas exposure are being badly impacted on no news. Passive investment... anything but passive in nature. Technical support levels have failed as the \"Buy the dip\" crowd has taken a walk. Oh, and the global growth story is not quite there either.\nNow, I also know something else, and this is really important because this is about you. Everyone gets knocked down. What is different about you is that you are as tough as these markets. Thinking about paper losses does you no good whatsoever. You are pragmatic. What matters is only what is. The only obstacle is the one to your front. What might have been? Let some fancy poet type worry about that crap. We worry only about how to best save our tail while not alarming the people that count on us. Now rise and fight. Let the hate build. Let the wicked know fear, for we shall not.\nTake that field today with honor. You've been punched in the mouth. So what. You'll be punched in the mouth again and again. Allow the weakness to exit. Embrace the challenge. Embrace the pain. Let the hatred turn to focus. They have tried to rattle you. You have not broken, nor will you. Ever. They have already lost. Glory.\nThere was some actual strength across the Utilities and the REITs. That makes some sense as traders sought the protection of safe haven while traversing rough terrain. What does not line up with the story-line very well would be the performance of Gold. Unlike other market scares, investors have not looked to the yellow metal for solace. Delayed reaction? Do they not understand? Do I not understand? Even as crypto-currencies continue to collapse, the only alternative currency that human hands can actually hold merely can hold it's ground in dollar terms. Then again, the dollar has steadily increased in value versus a basket of dollar peers since April. My thoughts? Investors still need some gold. On the day that we hope never comes, gold will buy water. You'll need water.\nWhile the Fed was mindlessly drawing liquidity out of the economy while simultaneously pushing short term rates up against long term yields, (If only someone would have warned them !!! This was not hard to figure out.) debt has continued to consistently grow... at the household, corporate, municipal, federal, and even global levels. What could possibly go wrong?\nAnyone read Ray Dalio's interview at Bloomberg on Tuesday? \"The whole world leveraged long.\" He's not wrong about that. \"Late stages of this short-term business cycle.\" Without a more sentient understanding of how to manage monetary policy, without serious progress on trade, without a more responsible approach to fiscal policy, without renewed or sustained economic growth elsewhere, Dalio could be right about that too.\nTuesday morning, the Census Bureau will lay down data on October Housing Starts as well as Building Permits. Does anyone really see these numbers printing at anything close to impressive levels in the wake of a November Homebuilder Optimism Index that printed at it's lowest level in more than two years on Monday? In fact, it looks to me that this was the largest one month drop in headline optimism in almost five years. I mean if October went well for builders, they probably would not be miserable in November. Know what I mean, Vern?\nWant more? Seventeen consecutive months of increased household debt. Increased student loan debt. Increased auto loan balances. Increased credit card balances. Some folks my age scoff at 5% mortgage rates. Time for us to get off of our high horse. These younger folks grew up in a tougher economic time than we did. Stop pretending that they did not. Five percent is an awful lot if it's the highest rates that you have ever seen, you already have some debt, and you were raised in an era where your parent were forced to forgo things like heat and electricity. Remember, personal debt was much smaller \"back in the day\". Our parents did not have credit cards, we barely used them ourselves, and borrowing to further one's education was not really a thing just yet. As a youngster, I had heard of people going away to college, but honestly... I had never met one until I already worked on Wall Street.\nBy now, we all know that reports of iPhone production cuts have put the whammy on not only Apple (AAPL) , but a bevy of semiconductor names as well. The news on Monday was that Apple had cut intended production for all three current models, and according to the Wall Street Journal, had cut orders for the iPhone XR twice just in October. The headline stock led the Monday retreat for the tech sector and for the major indices as well. Yes, I am still long Apple. Yes, the company did sort of signal this in the earnings call when the announcement came down that the firm would no longer provide unit sales figures for hardware sales. They also did guide the revenue range for the current quarter slightly lower.\nOn the bright side, there has often been negative news around new launches. In addition the firm is driving an ever increasing portion of it's revenue through the sale of subscription services, and that is a significant positive. Not every analyst has yet weighed in, and the drumbeat of negativity had started earlier this year. My thoughts on Apple are the following. I do still want to own the greatest consumer electronics company (perhaps the greatest company) of all-time. I would bless a sale for an investor that may have allowed him or herself to become overly exposed to this name. One thing that I think investors of this era do need to improve on is balancing a portfolio. The skew in recent years has been toward growth, and younger investors may have misinterpreted the group's past performance as offering a perception of safety. Again, this can be blamed directly on perverse monetary policy.\nOn a year to date chart, the $180 panic point that I had given you a few weeks ago is still the story. For me that level is probably an add. Yesterday, the lower low for the equity coupled with a higher low for Relative Strength could technically provide for today's trade a bullish divergence. From my perch at zero-dark thirty, the stock is still trading lower, but we'll see how this all shakes out soon enough.\nNow step back. The overhead view is more comforting. It would appear that trends going back three years may be unbroken. While a Pitchfork model covering that time frame does indeed show signs of being under pressure in recent days, a Raff Regression model contains the volatility over that time frame quite comfortably. Keep in mind, this stock is relatively cheap at 12 times forward looking earnings.\nApple will report Q1 earnings results on January 30th. Why not write a January 18th $200 call against your holdings. At one contract sold per 100 shares held, this puppy will still knock more than four bucks off of a trader's net basis. The risk associated? The trader has to sell the shares at $200 in two months. Worse things have happened to much better people. Sell puts?

        "output": "to longevity, according to Dan Buettner, founder of the Blue Zones Project.\nPeter Rizzo, the owner of Natural Wines in Naples, advises wine lovers to pursue healthy wines produced with a combination of green farming and natural yeasts.\n\u201cSeek out wines that are unfiltered, because that is where the good stuff resides for heart,\u201d Rizzo said.\nThere is a worldwide movement of clean farming with wine-making, similar to how wine was made before World War II without additives or chemicals, Rizzo said. His store, at 4949 U.S. 41 N., Unit 102, carries 250 wines and ships to customers, and his website, www.naturalwinesnaples.com, contains articles on the health benefits of natural wines.\nThe Blue Zones project was introduced to Southwest Florida in 2015 based on the travels of Buettner, a National Geographic explorer.\nHe identified communities worldwide where people share lifestyle traits and live to 100 or older. He wrote a New York Times best-seller about the nine principles of longevity.\nThe \u201cPower Nine\u201d include moving naturally by being physically active, eating a plant-slant diet, eating until you are 80 percent full and knowing your purpose in life. The other concepts are taking time to relax, having a healthy social network, belonging to a faith-based community and putting loved ones first.\nThe philosophy is that people can make simple changes in their daily practices to be healthier and, over time, the changes become natural.\nSome examples are parking farther away at work to add daily steps, removing the bread basket at restaurants, removing the salt shaker from tables and substituting fruit for sugary snacks.\nOrganizations that are central to daily living \u2014 such as employers, government entities, grocery stores, restaurants, residential communities, churches and civic organizations \u2014 are changing practices to be healthier and have become Blue Zones-recognized.\nTo date, 234 organizations have gained Blue Zones Project recognition or approval in Collier and Lee counties, and more than 500 organizations are participating in the initiative, according to Kate Walter, with the local Blue Zones Project.\nPart of the reasoning behind \u201cwine @ 5\u201d as one of the Power 9 is that the compound resveratrol, found in the skin of grapes, is known to protect the body against damage to blood vessels, may reduce the \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol of low-density lipoprotein and may prevent blood clots, according to the Mayo Clinic.\nIn 2017, Medical News Today published an article that referenced numerous studies about resveratrol and how it may offer health benefits, from boosting heart health to preventing some kinds of cancer.\nResearchers at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine found resveratrol may protect the brain from stroke damage.\nStill, a global study published in 2018 in the international medical journal The Lancet concluded there is no safe level of drinking alcohol.\nThe study, part of the annual Global Burden of Disease, assessed alcohol-related health outcomes and patterns from 1990 to 2016 in 195 counties. Nearly 3 million deaths globally were attributed to alcohol use. The study did not distinguish among beer, wine and hard liquor.\nThe Blue Zones Project website shares how the residents of Sardinia, Italy, are famous for their daily consumption of a regional red wine called Cannonau, which has two times the level of flavonoids, or antioxidants, that may lower risk of heart attacks.\nWine in moderation also may be beneficial if it is consumed with a Mediterranean diet that includes greens, beans, nuts, olive oil and whole grains, and low consumption of meat, according to The Blue Zones.\nBuettner teamed up with Healthways, a health consulting firm, in 2009 to develop and launch a detailed program to help guide communities to better health and wellness practices. The Blue Zones Project now works with Sharecare, a digital health company in Atlanta.\nEarly adopters of the Blue Zones Project include Albert Lea, Minnesota; and Spencer and Waterloo, Iowa, along with other cities in Iowa. In addition, projects are underway in Hawaii, Oklahoma, Oregon and Wisconsin. All told, more than 42 communities in nine states have launched Blue Zones Projects.\nThe NCH Healthcare System is underwriting the costs of the Blue Zones Project in Southwest Florida."

Instacart completed a round of funding in mid-November that values the company at $7.87 billion, according to Reuters.\n\u201cOther big tech startups in the 2019 IPO queue, according to people familiar with the matter, include workplace-messaging platform Slack Technologies Inc. as well as a raft of smaller but closely watched companies including food-delivery service Postmates Inc., security firms CrowdStrike Inc. and Cloudflare Inc., and videoconferencing-software provider Zoom Video Communications Inc.,\u201d reported the Wall Street Journal.\nAll five of the companies mentioned above have at least one immigrant founder. There is no startup visa that allows a foreign-born individual to obtain permanent residence (a green card) for founding a business. That\u2019s why immigrant entrepreneurs are almost always refugees or first sponsored by employers or family members. Even then, an individual in H-1B status may wait years for his or her green card before setting off to start a new business.\nImmigrant-founded billion-dollar companies employ an average of more than 1,200 employees per company (the vast majority of the jobs in the United States), according to the National Foundation for American Policy. These companies are also among the most exciting and valuable privately held businesses in America. Many are about to become even more valuable."

        "output": "diet and exercise. A healthy balanced diet consists of at least five portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables every day, fibre, some dairy, some protein, and small amounts of unsaturated oils and spreads. The exercise guidelines for adults aged 19 to 64 is 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity a week or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity a week, both mixed with strength exercises on two or more days a week.\nBut many researchers have dedicated time looking into other weight loss aids.\nA 1998 study carried out on 20 people found those who took 5-HTP consumed fewer calories from carbohydrates and fat than those taking a placebo.\n5-HTP, its full name 5-Hydroxytryptophan, is a naturally occurring amino acid found in foods like turkey, salmon, seeds and eggs.\nHolland & Barrett explains its benefits: \u201cOur bodies use 5-HTP to make the neurotransmitter serotonin, which is involved with the regulation of mood, appetite and gut function.\n\u201c5-HTP does not occur naturally in any foods, which means we can\u2019t get it from our diet. So, the idea of supplementing with 5-HTP is to remove the need to create it from tryptophan, which, in turn, is believed to raise serotonin levels in the body.\nA 2016 trial by researchers from Brunel University, found using brain imaging scan, 5-HTP can alter our brain activity when we look at food, shifting our focus away from high calorie and high carbohydrate foods, and towards healthier higher protein foods.\nThere is no recommended daily amount to take for 5-HTP, but studies have shown amounts raging from 50mg a day to 3300mg to be effective.\nThe high street health store further advises: \u201cDo not take 5-HTP without seeing your GP first, especially before taking higher doses.\nAnother supplement proven to aid weight loss is apple cider vinegar.\nAvailable as a liquid to add in drinks and in supplement form, apple cider vinegar has been found to reduce weight loss and appetite.\nA study published in 2018 looked at people who were actively trying to lose weight.\nThe research published in Journal of Functional Foods found dieters who had 1.5 tablespoons a day of apple cider vinegar lost more weight than those who only followed the diet.\nResearchers concluded apple cider vinegar may aid weight loss by helping to reduce appetite - its acetic acid content has been shown to reduce the absorption of starches in food and slow digestion, which in turn can help keep you fuller for longer.\nGlucomannan has also been found to aid weight loss."

        "output": "International last week wrote to the US Defence secretary, Robert Gates, calling for the restrictions on Bradley Manning to be reviewed. In the same week, the soldier suffered several days of increased restrictions by being temporarily categorized as a \u2018suicide risk\u2019.\nWe\u2019re concerned that the conditions inflicted on Bradley Manning are unnecessarily severe and amount to inhumane treatment by the US authorities. Manning has not been convicted of any offense, but military authorities appear to be using all available means to punish him while in detention. This undermines the United States\u2019 commitment to the principle of the presumption of innocence.\nLast Tuesday, Manning was placed on \u2018suicide risk\u2019, which resulted in him being stripped of his clothes apart from underwear, and the confiscation of his prescription glasses for most of the day, which Manning says left him in \u201cessential blindness\u201d.\nFollowing protests from Manning and his lawyers, the \u2018suicide risk\u2019 restrictions were lifted on Thursday.\nManning is classed as a \u201cmaximum custody\u201d detainee, despite having no history of violence or disciplinary offences in custody. This means he is shackled at the hands and legs during all visits and denied opportunities to work, which would allow him to leave his cell.\nManning is also detained under a Prevention of Injury (POI) assignment, despite a recommendation from his official military psychiatrist that this is not necessary. Detainees with POI status are subjected to extra restrictions such as checks by guards every five minutes and bars on sleeping.\nThere have been no formal reasons given for Manning\u2019s maximum custody and POI status, yet his lawyers\u2019 attempts to challenge the restrictions have been ignored by the authorities.\nThe repressive conditions imposed on Manning breach the US\u2019s obligations to treat detainees with humanity and dignity. Further, isolation and prolonged cellular confinement, which evidence shows can cause psychological impairment, may undermine Bradley Manning\u2019s ability to defend himself.\nIn April 2010, Wikileaks released leaked footage of attacks by US Apache helicopters, which killed two Reuters news staff in Iraq in 2007.\nManning was arrested the following month and then charged with \u201ctransferring classified data\u201d and \u201cdelivering national defense information to an unauthorized source\u201d.\nWikileaks has also since released large batches of information on the Iraq war, the Afghanistan war, and US diplomatic communications.\nManning could face a maximum sentence of 52 years in jail.\nHelp us end the punitive detention of Bradley Manning by taking action now.\nThis entry was posted in Security and Human Rights, USA and tagged bradley manning, Julian Assange, wikileaks by The Editors. Bookmark the permalink.\nThanks for this excellent column, demand and call to action.\nManning\u2019s treatment is horrendous and seems to be worsening as support for him grows. The Marines are getting more extreme in their arbitrary detention of David House and Jane Hamsher on Sunday and putting him on suicide watch last week, even though the psychiatrist at Quantico told them he did not need it. This led to him being denied everything except underwear for two days.\nIt is also important to re-think Manning\u2019s alleged crime. He is not accused of giving documents to Iran, China or Russia, but to the media. He is not accused of selling documents to the highest bidder to become wealth, he gave them away. According to the chat logs, if they are accurate, Manning wanted to expose crimes and start a debate. He wanted the U.S. to live up to its highest ideals. Isn\u2019t that patriotism rather than being a traitor?\nThe Bradley Manning Support Network, http://www.BradleyManning.org, put out the statement below this morning.\nQUANTICO, VA, 23 January 2011 \u2014 Military officials at Marine Corps Base Quantico today increased the isolation of accused WikiLeaks whistle-blower U.S. Army Pfc. Bradley Manning by detaining Manning\u2019s friend and regular visitor David House at the base entrance until visiting hours were over. House was accompanied by Jane Hamsher of Firedoglake.com, a website that has collected 42,000 signatures on a petition calling for improvements to the conditions of Manning\u2019s detention, which constitute extreme and illegal pre-trial punishment.\nDavid House has been making regular trips from his home in the Boston area to visit Manning at the Marine Corps brig since he was transferred there from Kuwait last summer. While detained at the base gate, House posted to Twitter that \u201cone of the many MPs around the car says his orders to stop us come from on high.\u201d House and Hamsher were held on entry to the base for nearly the entire period of visiting hours, repeatedly demanded to provide information and documents the MPs already had, and threatened with arrest. Hamsher\u2019s car was towed away under the pretext that she lacked proof of insurance, despite having presented a digital copy.\n\u201cThis is a bizarre action by the Marines. I think they see the growing support for Bradley Manning, they see more and more people realizing that he is being treated unfairly, and that as the facts of the case come out more and more people see that he is a patriot and not a traitor,\u201d said Kevin Zeese, Director of Voters for Peace and member of the Bradley Manning Support Network\u2019s steering committee.\nIn a letter to Defense Secretary Robert Gates last week, Amnesty International stated that \u201cthe restrictions imposed in PFC Manning\u2019s case appear to be unnecessarily harsh and punitive.\u201d The letter also suggests that Manning\u2019s confinement is in contravention of international law, and calls upon the military to conduct a review.\nHouse intends to return to Quantico next weekend to once again attempt to visit Manning and to deliver the petition.\nIn addition to petitions and public protests across the nation, the Bradley Manning Support Network has asked supporters to speak out against Manning\u2019s inhumane treatment by contacting officials at Quantico. The Support Network encourages concerned individuals to phone Quantico public affairs at +1-703-432-0289, to write to base commander Colonel Choike at 3250 Catlin Avenue, Quantico, VA 22134, and to write to brig commander CWO4 Averhart at 3247 Elrod Avenue, Quantico, VA 22134. We are asking that Bradley Manning\u2019s human rights be respected while he remains in custody; specifically, that he be allowed social interaction with other inmates, that he be allowed meaningful physical exercise, that approved visitors be allowed to see him without interrogation and harassment, and that the \u201cPrevention of Injury\u201d order (the military\u2019s basis for the extreme pre-trial punishment regime) be lifted.\nA plan to ruin someone's psychological health so that they cannot withstand trial is despicable. The consequences of such a policy extend far beyond the time in jail or the trial date, through the rest of his life.\nThe actions this man took seem to have been an attempt to make the world a more fair, just place. To treat him so blatantly unjustly is to prove yourselves worse than the crime you accuse him of committing.\nI had never in my LIFE been afraid to speak my mind in my own country until this past year. The US's behavior is unbeLIEVEable to me right now. I'm in shock.\nWho would have thought that Dubya would be better on Human Rights then Obama. What a sad day for America. Truly headed towards the socialism/communism that Hitler/Stalin/Pol Pot believed in.\nWhile I'm reading this, I wonder what progress we are making.\nMost of these soldiers are just kids, between 18 and 25 years, without any kind of ethical or spiritual formation. They only have one virtue, to serve the country or to any corporation, in which one must have an empty brain, as the ideas they fill their heads with building bigger and better idiots, so far EU is winning.\nIt is impossible trust anyone that can not think for itself. For this reason, I am fully convinced that Soldier Bradley Manning is not only an exception if not a hero.\nThe states use false training standards as the false development of the race or love of country by underestimating what is of true value in life.\nIt saddens me deeply that these children going to war believe that this is a game, and that humans are just toys.\nAn intelligent and mature man would never go to war or kill anyone. Wars are human blood factories. and unfortunately, our hero Bradley discovered it too late.\nGood luck getting the US to respect human rights. If they can justify kidnappings, torture, illegal executions, secret prisons, illegally spying on civilians, illegal wars, recklessly sabotaging nuclear installations, assisting in Israel's land grabs and using predator drones to monitor civilians, they can find a way to justify torturing a soldier so he can psychologically no longer defend himself. Apparently it's the new American way.\nWell of course Iran, the country Bradley Manning hoped and intended would be the main beneficiary of his treason does not bother to keep its prisoners in such \"terrible conditions\" as poor little traitor Bradley suffers in.\nNope, Iran just tortures and executes them.\n50 executions in Iran in the last week, many of them political prisoners or activists for oppressed ethnic groups. I am sure all you people who wrote in outraged apparently because Bradley Manning is not being kept in a 5 start hotel with room service, are equally upset at the 50 executions in the last week in Iran.\nVery simply put, a man named Obama has learned to manipulate liberals by imitating MLK, among others in everything but deed, so he can do anything he ultimately wants. He has gotten liberals to forsake every principal they once claimed to stand for, from the indiscriminate and horrifically cruel killing of families via the sterile but apparently to Obama humorous Predator drones, to the obvious torture of Bradley Manning in order to get him to turn on Wikileaks and indict Assange. Frank Rich and the other liberals are silent on this and their silence is a condonation of the Nazi-like cruelty. They are mesmerized by their own image of themselves as liberal crusaders behind the reincarnation of MLK even though, as it turns out, Obama is a vicious right wing narcissist who has but one goal and that's the extension of his power. He is utterly immoral. On New Year's eve of this year, his drones killed five people in Pakistan who were carrying their dead from an earlier drone strike. Apparently, Mr. Obama either likes the idea of bloodshed or he believes he's doing this to gain yet more power. No doubt Hitler would be capable of this horrific behavior but few leaders, other than Obama himself, have been willing to go this far.\nJim, you're an idiot. A zealot. But an idiot just the same.\nIran has criticized the WikiLeaks documents. They do not like what they say either.\nIf Manning wanted to benefit Iran he would have leaked or sold the documents to Iran! He didn't and is not accused of doing so. He is accused of giving the documents to the media.\nThe main beneficiary of the leaks Manning is accused of making would be the United States. The American people are lied to about U.S. foreign policy. Now that the truth is known we can work to change U.S. foreign policy so we operate within the law and not as a rogue state.\nThere should be a way to protect human beings who put their citizenship to the world, above any citizenship. Bi-nationals feel sometimes sort of teared up with conflicting loyalties, but in fact, if one did think, profundly think, there is no possibility of being disloyal to nothing if one follows simple basic human rights and ideals.\nI'm sure the US Constitution is not contradictory with the basic principles of humanity this soldier tried to follow. He should be decorated as a man of honour who tried to protect the honour and Ideals of his Country.\nFreedom of speech and of the press are among the fundamental personal rights and liberties. He had a duty, as a soldier. He did his duty, toward his people, his Nation. If the people in charge were twisted, they should be questionned. Not this man who went to fight for Liberty, Rights, Ideals \u2026 and refused to see them trashed. Save this young guy, and the Spirit some try to forget.\nThe reason why Manning is going to get a well deserved sentence of life in prison without parole under full military discipline till the day he dies in the Leavenworth Maximum Security Federal Military penitentiary.\nThe wordings of the current oath of enlistment for the United States Army, and oath Manning swore to only 3 years ago.\nI, Bradley Manning, do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States and the orders of the officers appointed over me, according to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. So help me God.\n(Title 10, US Code; Act of 5 May 1960 replacing the wording first adopted in 1789, with amendment effective 5 October 1962).\nA plan to ruin someone\u2019s psychological health so that they cannot withstand trial is despicable. The consequences of such a policy extend far beyond the time in jail or the trial date, through the rest of his life.\nI had never in my LIFE been afraid to speak my mind in my own country until this past year. The US\u2019s behavior is unbeLIEVEable to me right now. I\u2019m in shock.\nFinally, some sort of action from Amnesty. But why has AI refused to declare Manning as a Prisoner of Conscience?\nThe President of the United States certainly didn't ask his army to act shamefully. To follow international law, and international Humanitarian Law is an obligation for all States and their armies.\nNo State can't be above these basic principles of Human Rights and Laws of War\u2026 The law is mandatory for nations bound by this panel of laws, treaties, and basic simple customary unwritten rules of war. So this soldier remained true to President(s) who, whatever the President, didn't declare war on Human Rights, Justice and international Community (which has the duty to ensure compliance to these rules). I'm sure the President(s) of the United STates love freedom, democracy too much to ask the army to be outlaws.\nSorry you don't use your name. It would be good to see where you are coming from.\nSo, with that oath, what is a soldier supposed to when s/he sees crimes being committed by his military? Under the Nuremberg Principles hiding the crimes makes him complicit. Just following orders is no excuse. So, what should he or she to do?\nAnd is it defending the Constitution when we allow a citizen that has not been found guilty of anything (who is innocent until proven guilty) to be tortured by solitary confinement pre-trial. What should those Marines guarding him do? Should they remain silent and complicit to violations of the 8th Amendment?\nIt is not as simple as you make it out to be. It the U.S. were a law abiding foreign policy player, not fighting illegal wars, not torturing people, not killing civilians wantonly etc. \u2014 you'd be right. But that is not the case. The U.S. is in illegal wars and committing war crimes regularly then lying to the people about it.\nWe are a representative Democracy that is a republic (i.e. laws matter). How are civilians supposed to take responsibility for the actions of their elected representatives when we are lied to?

Sure, he may have gone to prison for a few months but that is about it. The Blackwawk massacre was a cover up of a terrible killing of civilians, and even though the pilot and crewman who pulled the trigger were under an honestly mistaken belief that they were killing armed soldiers, they in fact killed women and children.\nBut Manning did not stop this the Blackhawk video . He continued to also release hundreds of thousands of other documents, 99% of which had absolutely no relevance what so ever to US war crimes or illegal acts, and did not help expose any wrongdoings. Many of these secret documents include the names of people who had confidential contact with the US, like for example human rights activists under oppressive regimes secretly asking the US for help.\nThe thousands of innocent people named in the documents Manning released had the right to have their names be kept secret but now many of them, exactly the kinds of people Amnesty International would otherwise support, face serious risk of arrest, torture and execution all thanks to Manning.\nIn the closing weeks of 2010 I wrote a number of letters asking why, after more than 7 MONTHS Amnesty International had said and done nothing. 7 months of an unlawful, unjust and inhumane incarceration of Bradly Manning. Well at last, they have decided that public opinion must have swung against them enough for them to be seen to be doing something.

He is utterly immoral. On New Year's eve of this year, his drones killed five people in Pakistan who were carrying their dead from an earlier drone strike. Apparently, Mr. Obama either likes the idea of bloodshed or he believes he's doing this to gain yet more power. No doubt Hitler would be capable of this horrific behavior but few leaders, other than Obama himself, have been willing to go this far.\nIf they can justify kidnappings, torture, illegal executions, secret prisons, illegally spying on civilians, illegal wars, recklessly sabotaging nuclear installations, assisting in Israel's land grabs and using predator drones to monitor civilians, they can find a way to justify torturing a soldier so he can psychologically no longer defend himself.

        "output": "a serving of vegetables? Essentially that was the question being asked.\nAccording to Reuters, Congress was debating changes to a spending bill that would have eliminated pizza's status as a vegetable and limited how often French fries could be served in federally subsidized school lunches.\nIt all stemmed from a 2010 child nutrition law that wanted to influence schools to improve the nutrition in lunches served to almost 32 million US school children.\nThe obesity warriors in the U.S. were disappointed when the changes were shot down, pizza and French fries will continue to be served at the current rate. These items are currently served at a rate of everyday, which is probably too often.\nThe Washington Post made sure to let everyone know that the government did not declare that pizza is a vegetable. Their defenses of the government\u2019s attempts to control school children\u2019s lunches do not make what went down seem any less foolish.\nIt also makes you wonder what the Post\u2019s motivations as a news organization are when they defend government buffoonery so strongly.\nNo, the government does not believe that pizza is the same thing as a scoop of broccoli or carrots. However, a stupid loophole has allowed the tomato sauce on pizza to count as a serving of vegetables for years.\nCurrently, two tablespoons of tomato paste on a piece of pizza is enough for it to pass through the legal loophole as a serving of vegetables. The child obesity crusaders wanted the amount of tomato sauce to be raised to a half-cup of tomato paste to qualify pizza as a vegetable serving.\nOf course this was shot down, and the lesser amount of tomato sauce will still qualify the sauce on pizza as a vegetable.\nThe real stupidity of this situation is how lobbyists like the American Frozen Food Institute (AFFI) did the work to get the changes shot down. The Star Tribune in Minnesota has it on record that one of AFFI\u2019s members - Schwan Food Co - has donated money to the campaigns of many members of the Minnesota congressional delegation.\nHow much do you want to bet that they donated money in several other states too?\nThis whole pizza situation has benefitted the makers of frozen pizza who have nice fat deals with the government\u2019s public school system. Because the changes were shot down, ConAgra Foods Inc. and Schwan Food Co will not have to make any changes to their products. This means that they can watch the money continue to roll in while kids continue to eat substandard frozen pizza every day.\nThe government and the First Lady make all of these claims that obesity is an epidemic and that something needs to be done. They all act like they care about the health of children, yet they allow money to win out once things get serious.\nLuckily most parents can still send their kids to school with a lunch from home that is actually crafted with nutrition in mind. Enjoy that freedom while you can because one school in Chicago has banned lunches from home unless there is a doctor\u2019s note.\nWho really cares about the nutrition kids are receiving in public schools? Not your government and their friends in the frozen pizza industry. They've shown that their only concern is continuing to use the health of kids in public school as a political tool. They could have switched from pizza to something more healthy, yet they choose to carry on a petty battle over tomato sauce."

But a Ministry of Defence report, slipped out over Christmas, reveals that spending on the project\u2019s \u201cassessment phase\u201d is to increase by a further \u00a3261m this year. Of this money, which will be drawn down from the project\u2019s future budget, \u00a3206m will be spent on new facilities at the BAE Systems shipyard at Barrow-in-Furness.\nOn Tuesday the SNP and Plaid Cymru will force a debate on the Trident upgrade, which is expected to cost \u00a320bn in total.\nAngus Robertson, the SNP\u2019s Westminster leader and defence spokesman, said: \u201cWhen Labour MPs have voted with the Tories for another \u00a330bn of austerity cuts, it is frankly scandalous that a further quarter of a billion pounds of taxpayers\u2019 money is to be spent on Trident before parliamentarians even get a vote on whether or not to replace the system.\nThe MoD report, The UK\u2019s future nuclear deterrent: 2014 update to Parliament, reveals that more than half a billion pounds \u2013 some \u00a31.4m a day \u2013 was spent on the project in the last financial year alone. Much of this went on \u201clong lead\u201d items to build specialist parts for the new submarines, such as their propulsion and missile launching systems.\nIt is estimated that \u00a31.24bn has been spent on the project so far, the same amount as chancellor George Osborne pledged to find in new money for the NHS. The MoD claims that its spending decisions will reduce the overall cost of the replacement programme by \u00a342m.\nBut the report reveals that the total cost of the project\u2019s assessment phase, at the end of which a decision on whether to proceed with Trident\u2019s successor will be taken, will rise to \u00a33.3bn, nearly \u00a3300m more than the MoD originally indicated.\nThe revelation has prompted fury from pro-disarmament parties, which could play a crucial role in any future coalition government.\nThey accuse the MoD of spending so much on the project that the next government will find it impossible to abandon.\nThe Greens joined the SNP and Plaid in accusing the government of seeking to bury a key issue for voters.\nThe MoD and the Conservatives are believed to want the UK to have four submarines in any future deterrent fleet.\nThe Lib Dems suggest that the UK could get by with fewer submarines, which would not have to be on constant patrol as is the case now.\nLabour leader Ed Miliband has indicated that he wants Trident replaced with a cheaper system. Many in his party would like it scrapped altogether. \u201cThis is a useless, hugely expensive virility symbol which will never be used,\u201d said Labour MP Paul Flynn."

        "output": "feet, about 14 stories. That means future developments could be two stories taller than the tallest building currently under construction downtown.\n\u201cI\u2019m comfortable with 160 feet because I'm comfortable with 140 feet,\" East Lansing Mayor Mark Meadows said.\nThe ordinance makes downtown more flexible for future growth, he said.\nThe new rules follow a flurry of new development downtown. The council has approved three high-rise apartment projects since October of 2017, all of them along Grand River Avenue. All told, they'll add 930 apartments and 867 parking spaces to downtown East Lansing.\nMeadows said the development underway has already enticed people to look into buying property downtown, although he said he's not aware of any specific development proposals in the works.\n\u201cThe value of that extra two stories is what makes the difference in purchasing a property for a higher value,\" he said.\nThe new rules apply to the four blocks east of Abbot Road and west of Bailey Street in between Albert Avenue and Grand River Avenue.\nThe bumped-up height restrictions were meet with criticism from some quarters.\nDavid Ledebuhr, who owns the building containing the now-closed Menna's Joint and Black Cat Bistro wrote to the City Council to express concern about the proposal.\n\"By only placing the Grand River frontage and Albert frontage facing north, you are creating a Tall (sic) wall with no depth,\" he wrote.\nThe original ordinance also included the areas adjacent to the Peoples Church. About 30 members of the church protested the increased height proposal at the board's April 9 meeting. Many cited parking issues and the ordinance's divergence from the master plan the city approved last year.\nThe master plan recommends that buildings in the area adjacent to the church be a maximum of 10 stories.\n\"(This ordinance) is the wrong thing at the wrong time,\" said George Brookover, the church's attorney. \"And the community has invested tons of effort into the master plan, the comprehensive plan to make these decisions.\"\nMeadows said the height restrictions in the master plan weren't in line with the projects the city had already approved for parts of downtown.\nHe also amended the ordinance so that it no longer includes the area adjacent to the church and the land at the corner of Abbot and Grand River intended for the Park District project, a 10-story hotel and 11-story apartment building.\nMeadows said he expects a mix of buildings to make up East Lansing's downtown.\n\u201cYou\u2019re always going to have low-rise and high-rise buildings in an area,\" he said. \"This isn\u2019t New York City. You\u2019re not going to all of a sudden see Grand River turn into a bunch of 14-story buildings.\"\nAnd a more dense downtown is good for businesses, Meadows said. More residents living downtown will bring in additional foot traffic, he said.\nBut density doesn't necessarily require height, said Christopher Zimmerman, vice president for economic development at Smart Growth America, an urban planning and development non-profit based in Washington D.C.\nRather, density depends more on the way space is used, he said.\nZimmerman said height also isn't the most important factor for cities to consider when looking at new developments. The important thing is that streetscapes are designed to be welcoming for people walk on. People shouldn't walk past loading docks and blank space.\nAn additional 20 feet of height on a building likely won't make a big difference, he said.\n\"My guess is most people wouldn't notice the difference between a 140-foot building and a 160-foot building,\" he said.\nStill, tall buildings can become jarring if they're not designed well, said Lars Graebner, a professor of practice in architecture at the University of Michigan and principle of VolumeOne Design Studio in Detroit. A tall building is less intimidating if its footprint isn't large and architects use design tools such as setbacks.\n\u201cThe height can sometimes be positive, but it can also sometimes be devastating depending on the facade and design,\" Graebner said.\nThe ordinance approved Tuesday originally came about in response to the proposed Park Place project on the current Dublin Square site in downtown.\nThe final version didn't include the properties.\nOkemos-based Vlahakis Companies and Royal Properties of Champaign, Illinois, submitted plans to the city in December for two 14-story buildings near the corner of Abbot Road and Albert Avenue.\nTogether, the buildings would have 80 condominiums, 450 parking spaces, 410 market-rate apartments, a 34,000-square-foot movie theater, 24,000 square feet of office space and 25,000 square feet of retail space.\nSome of the sites the developers plan to use are zoned B-3, which only allows for up to six stories. That prompted the need for increased height restrictions.\nBut Meadows said Tuesday night that residents shouldn't expect Dublin Square to be torn down anytime soon.\n\u201cNot everything works out the way you hope in the beginning,\" he said .\nDeveloper Paul Vlahakis did not return calls seeking comment last week.\nVlahakis previously told the State Journal that the additional height was key in marketing the condos at the top of one of the buildings.\nEast Lansing City Council Member Shanna Draheim voted no on the proposal. She said she's not opposed to taller buildings downtown but that the ordinance felt rushed. She said she wanted to wait on the issue to get more feedback from residents.\n\u201cWe all want a movie theater downtown,\" she said. \"But I also care about the way things look.\"\nKathleen Boyle, vice chair of the planning commission and a former East Lansing City Council member, said the city needs to slow down and wait and see the response to the developments currently under construction.\nShe also said she didn't like that the ordinance came about because of the Park Place proposal."

Worldwide, adults are said to spend on average $475 on gifts, half of which are unwanted, but in this throwaway world of ours, instead of returning them, most of these rejected trinkets are dumped in the rubbish bin and end up in a landfill site.\nChristmas and rubbish are synonymous terms in more ways than one. It\u2019s the time of year when the largest amount of consumer waste is produced and the overwhelming bulk ends up in a hole in the ground. Over 114,000 tons of plastic waste is estimated to have been produced in Britain over Christmas and not recycled, together with \u201cmore than 88,000,000 Sq. m of wrapping paper and 300,000 tonnes of card packaging\u201d, The Times relates. In the Capital of Consumerism, America, a colossal $10 million is spent on wrapping paper, most of which is not recyclable, and the number of Christmas cards sold requires 300,000 trees to be cut down.\nThen there\u2019s the unbridled cruelty reserved for the animals that are raised for the festive table; around 10 million turkeys are eaten in Britain; it\u2019s closer to 25 million in America, where the major turkey cull is Thanksgiving. The vast majority of birds stuffed and roasted are factory farmed. Their short lives are spent in appalling conditions and end when they are plunged head first into electrified stunning baths, after which they have their throats cut in the slaughterhouse. The industrial farming of turkeys is not just barbaric, like all animal agriculture it produces huge amounts of the greenhouse gases which fuel man-made climate change. Add in Christmas travel by road and air and the enormous environmental impact of Christmas begins to become clear: from 15th December to 4th January a record 52 million people in America took to the air and 97 million hit the highways. In Britain over thirteen million vehicles clogged the roads in the days leading up to the Big Day, and both Heathrow and Gatwick airports had their busiest days on record: around four million people in total, with record numbers taking long-haul flights. Aviation is a major source of greenhouse gases, and the further one flies the greater the environmental damage.\nWhilst the festive period allows much needed time for rest, and for some, warm family gatherings (tense misery for others), in its current form it is little more than an exercise in mass consumerism. The \u2018Christmas Spirit\u2019, which suggests peace, brotherhood and \u2018goodwill to all men\u2019, is widely absent, replaced by an exaggerated version of how life is conducted the rest of the year; contemporary values (which are not values at all, of course) of greed and selfishness are relentlessly encouraged and to a large degree, prevail.\nThis article was posted on Thursday, February 8th, 2018 at 9:29pm and is filed under Capitalism, Consumer Advocacy, Culture, Environment, Fossil Fuel Emissions, Life/Animal Rights, Methane emissions, Plastic, Pollution, United Kingdom, United States."

He never put Okinawa or its people first; it was always about him, his backers and getting reelected. Through the years he changed his stripes so many times he could have painted a",
        "output": "whole heard of zebras. These changes were not about a maturing philosophy, he just flip-flopped to suit whatever got him in front of the media, money and elected to office. The man\u2019s ego always proceeded him and he preened in media attention, which the Okinawa \u201cbought and paid for\u201d TV stations, such as RBC were willing to provide. A good example of his conceit and arrogance was his wearing of that monstrosity helmet wig. He continued to refuse to admit he was bald when he became ill, he insisted on wearing a hat to cover his baldness. When he found the golden goose in opposing the US military bases, Okinawa\u2019s bigger and more pressing problems were pushed so far down the list to be ignored while he railed on getting rid of the US military. I only hope the People of Okinawa will wake up and elect a governor who has the integrity and courage to have a balanced administration and actually govern for the benefit of all the people and their needs and not just the special interest group that has been buying the governors\u2019 office for several years.\nThe rules don't apply to celebrities, everyone knows that. When you get caught with your hand in the cookie jar, just blame someone else........ kinda like I was drunk at the time.\nIf the Okinawa people want the bases out, that is their call. But it should be the choice of the OKINAWA people, not the faction that has hijacked Okinawa politics. People are starting to wake up and realize that the steady diet of anti-base propaganda is not reality. I agree that Okinawa has an unbalanced percentage of US troops, but a reduction and compromise should be worked out with the central government based on mutual respect and the wishes of the majority of the Okinawa people. Onaga and the other puppet government officials have thrown Okinawa under the bus to achieve their political agenda, which has absolutely nothing to do with the welfare of the Okinawan people. When you have all the radio, TV and newspapers on Okinawa in the political regime's pocket and in full propaganda mode, you know something is rotten and stinks on high.\nWhen the grid fails and you are standing in a pile of rubble, a coin in your pocket will still spend.\nBack to the helicopter problem........ The Marines are suffering from the same infliction that their parent DOD branch is undergoing. When the Navy had several major ship accidents in less than a year, they were in a state of denial until the accident reports came out. Seasoned military aircraft mechanics will tell you there is no such thing as an old aircraft but there is such a thing as a poorly maintained aircraft. The military has a lot of old aircraft the are better than they were when they rolled off the assembly line. The MC has a maintenance problem, the sooner they come to grips with that fact the better for them and everyone around them. The Navy moved to fire and prosecute personnel from admirals on down, its time for the MC to do the same. Maybe start with the MC general on Okinawa?\nThe Japanese Government pays the land owners far more than fair market value for rent. The land owner of a 200 tsubo plot, which is about the size of a standard US city lot, gets $90,000 a year rent. If you live in a noise zone around an air base you get noise canx windows installed and upgraded every 10 years, you get air conditioners and ventilation installed and replaced for free. The children of residents of Kadena town go to school free. Every Japanese worker that works on base in a GOJ supported position, gets hardship pay and language pay on top of location pay and their regular salary. There is a lot of very upset Okinawan people who owned worthless mountain land that was being used as the Northern Training Area, about 10,000 acres, that was returned to them. Onaga and his agenda made them loose millions of yen. What does Japan get in return? It rents the worlds most powerful military at a fraction of the cost it would cost to field it.\nIts amazing how anything you feed your pet that does not come out of a can or package labeled dog/cat food is bad for your pet! I suspect a bit of fear mongering by the pet food industry.\n\"All our weapons, including atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs and ballistic missiles are only aimed at the United States, not our brethren, nor China and Russia,\" Pyongyang's chief negotiator, Ri Son Gwon, said.\n.........and what do these US and ROK troops do when lil' Dumplin starts chucking missiles at the US? Wave?... don't think so. If NK goes hostile toward anyone, it will have to include SK.\nIf she didn't know anything then why doesn't she just shut up now?\nStreep says in a statement Monday that Weinstein \"needed me much more than I needed him and he made sure I didn't know.\" The Oscar winner says her association with him brought him credibility, which she says he used \"to lure young, aspiring women into circumstances where they would be hurt.\"\nYeah Meryl, we believe you! I had to read this paragraph twice to believe my eyes. Talk about a conceded statement! With the voracious gossip and rumor machine in Hollywood, how could anyone on the inside not know? The hypocrisy of these people totally destroys any credibility they pretend to have.\nIn 1996 the Japanese Government and US Government agreed on relocating MCAS Futenma from the densely populated area in Ginowan to Camp Schawb which is located in the far north of Okinawa. The move entailed building a V shaped runway into the bay that forms one side of Camp Schwab. Initially this move was hailed as a good solution by both the Okinawa government and Japan, but then a political faction, with one paramount agenda to oust all American Forces came to power, fueled with outside money. This faction has used continuous delaying tactics to drag the move out for over 20 years, with no regard to the wishes of the people of Okinawa. The influx of millions of outside political money has ensured this faction remains in power. The newspapers and TV on Okinawa are controlled by this faction and report a continuous diet of fake or distorted news and disinformation, while the Okinawa people continue to suffer from a government that that does address it's real problems and needs.\nI don't think so. The bases have substantially retarded Okinawa's growth as a tourist destination. It's ideally located to become the Hawaii of East Asia, especially with the new casino legislation having been passed and hundreds of millions of Chinese tourists just an hour or two away by plane.\nThe economy would not collapse, but there would be a significant impact that would take several years to recover from. Tourists are great, but what is not being said is the overcrowding, crime, and inflated prices that comes from them. Tourism has been around for many years on Okinawa and the average Okinawan has not benefited. All the construction, hotels and tourist destinations are owned/operated by mainland Japanese companies, the money goes back to Japan. Okinawa still has the highest unemployment of any prefecture, along with the highest rate of alcoholism, lowest school test scores, highest divorce rate, AND food prices here are higher than mainland Japan. What is the cause?..... Corrupt government from the prefecture level on down.\nAdd in where do those troops go on US soil, current bases got space to accommodate them all, or new bases would need to be build prior to moving them.\nNot true, there are many military bases in the US that have been downsized and with very little effort and expense, could be reactivated to capacity. When the US government considers closing a base in the US, the city and state where it is located, protests the CLOSING of the base. They recognize the economic impact. You would be very hard pressed to find any city that would turn down having a base located nearby.\nThe solution is simple, have a referendum vote and let the people decide. But this is something else that will not happen. The political machine that has Okinawa in its grip will see to that. There is so much outside money that is poured into Okinawa politics, it is impossible for a pro people candidate to win. This machine has an agenda of it's own and cares not the least for the people of Okinawa. There are regular posters on JT who are drinking the Kool-Aid and aiding and abetting the machine either knowingly or thinking they are noble by howling for the ouster of the US Military. If the Okinawa people want the US gone, then it should be made so. Up to this point, all the rancor and indignation is a product of the Japanese Communist Party and the Far Right Ultra-nationalists........ get the pitch forks and get rid of the round eye devils!\nAny discussion of Micky Ds always brings out a lot of people who rant on how bad their food is, I can't understand why they have to express an opinion on it, if you don't like it just don't go there. I like it sometimes, I like sushi, would not eat either one every day. I strongly dislike tofu, but would not disparage anyone who does................and YES, bring back the quarter pounder!\nSeen this room before in other photos and interviews with audio. It is a \"set\" and the pegboard wall is acoustic dampening. Not sure why they chose it for a photo op though.\nAgree... I once found a boat adrift about three miles off the coast, it was a japanese registered fishing boat. I called the J/coast guard and reported it. The next day I was \"requested\" to come to the local office for an \"interview\". It lasted just over 3 hours. They then hounded me for a couple of more months with the same questions........how many ways can you say you saw the boat floating, investigated, no one was on board and then you called the Coast Guard.\nturning the home into a corporate store front,\" the McAfee report said.\nThis coming from a company that will constantly pilfer use data from your computer and spam you to death if your use their software.\nI suspect she will marry early to a commoner to get out of the Imperial Prison and its inflexible littleny of keepers.\nThe government should just let the man retire while he still has time to enjoy it.

Posts like yours are just troll poop.\nI think they do it to flavor it up as there's less fat than the US burgers.\nThe meat is from Aust. or NZ and the chicken nuggets from either Thailand or Viet Nam.\nLauer just got his ticket punched on the Karma Train and Ann Curry was the conductor.\nThe thing is this: Takanoiwa was photographed smiling at training the following day and them making a courtesy visit to a local city hall in Fukuoka.\nI did not really catch all of the piece, but I saw what i thought was a news piece about the gash and stitches on Takanoiwa's head, I believe it was yesterday, did anyone else see this? There was a picture of his scalp.\nThere has been something \"fishy\" going on in Sumo for a couple of years now. The wins and losses are not consistent. When one Yokozuna's get too far ahead in wins, they mysteriously lose a couple of matches. I suspect they are pressured to do this to keep the customers attention. In the last tournament, everyone heard the referee shout stop, that is why Hakuho stopped fighting and got pushed out of the match for his only loss. The judges let it stand. Hakuho protested and now is being reprimanded for his actions.\nGet real that is so out of topic and way off target. The various aisles and different drinks is not about being supportive of drinking irresponsibly, but rather sales.\nSure it is about sales and more sales and then more sales. It constitutes enabling and just reinforces how important alcohol is in military culture. When a person walks into a military convenience store and the ratio of alcohol products to food products is 3 to 1, it just reinforces and normalizes the use of alcohol. I drink, sometimes I get a bit drunk. I don't advocate getting rid of alcohol, but when you have excessive access, its use and consumption becomes trivialized,and not something that needs to be treated with respect and care.\nI'm not so sure it is BS. Harumafuji has shown himself willing to do things the easy way in a number of his matches when he needed to win. His performance as a Grand Champion has been mediocre at best. The reports say Takanohana was being \"counseled\" by the other Mongolian wrestlers or was it bullying? There has been a lot of suspicious wins, matches, and \"injuries\" lately in MHO.\nThe military wonders why it has a drinking problem, all you have to do is walk into one of the AAFES stores on base and the reason will be clear. Let's take the most mind boggling of these; the Kadena on base service station. It has exactly two and a half center shelves with automobile related merchandise. The other three double sided aisles are alcohol. Everything from hard liquor to wine and beer. Between the aisles and on the ends are cases of craft beers and ciders stacked 3 or 4 high. The AAFES run convenience stores are the same. One or two aisles of junk food and the rest alcohol.\nI guess a slight bonus is, I don't ever see seniors using smart phones and driving.\nYour are correct.... they slam on the brakes and swerve off to the side while fishing for the ringing phone. Then they carry on with the conversation with the rear of the car sticking out in traffic or if the road is narrow, completely blocking the lane."

        "input": "When Iowa state Sen. Matt McCoy learned Donald Trump had appointed Matthew Whitaker to be acting attorney general of the United States, he was aghast -- he believes Whitaker was behind a politically motivated prosecution that was personally \"devastating\" to him.\nIt started in 2007, when McCoy was a rising Democrat",
        "output": "in state politics, and the state's first openly gay lawmaker. Whitaker was the US attorney for Iowa's Southern District at the time.\nA grand jury indictment accused McCoy of using his elected office to try to extort $2,000 from a Des Moines home security company where McCoy was a consultant. The charges came after an elaborate undercover investigation in which the FBI had McCoy's business partner wear a recording device. McCoy demanded money he says he was owed for his consulting work.\nIn an interview with CNN this week, McCoy said Whitaker \"certainly tried to prove that I had done something really awful when, in fact, it was a garden variety business dispute that should have been handled in small claims court, if anywhere.\"\nThe trial lasted more than a week, with prosecutors trying to prove the business partner never agreed to pay McCoy for his consulting and the defense torpedoing the partner's testimony because he couldn't recall many details and admitted he had trouble with sobriety, according to Des Moines Register articles on the trial.\nIn the end, the jury reached a not guilty verdict in an hour and a half, including time for lunch, according to the Des Moines Register.\n\"I believe it was a political prosecution, there's no doubt in mind, I'm 100% certain that it was,\" McCoy said, adding he believes he was targeted not just because he's a Democrat, but also because he's gay. \"As US attorney (Whitaker) spoke at Christian Coalition events and would often refer to bringing God into his decision-making process and being guided by God's hand,\" McCoy said, \"and so I believe that he was very much resentful of my lifestyle and I believe that played a factor in it.\"\nWhitaker has been facing questions from reporters about whether the case was politically motivated since the day the indictment was announced in 2007. An editorial in the Des Moines Register soon after McCoy was acquitted called for the government to compensate McCoy for his legal fees and questioned, \"Was the McCoy prosecution a product of poor judgment, inexperience, misplaced zeal or partisan politicking? Perhaps all of the above.\"\nA Justice Department official sent a statement to CNN defending the case. \"As a U.S. Attorney, then-US Attorney Whitaker had a responsibility to uphold the rule of law and pursue credible allegations of illegal activity. The Department of Justice signed off on bringing the case, the FBI conducted an independent investigation, and career prosecutors handled the case throughout its duration. The jury's verdict does not negate the obligation of law enforcement agencies to open cases when they determine laws may have been broken.\"\nMcCoy said the two-year legal battle exhausted his finances and left a lasting impact on his life. \"I was putting my whole family in an emotional state as a result of that. I had elderly parents, I had a young son ... It took an emotional toll on the people that I loved and it was completely unnecessary.\"\nMcCoy continued as a state senator for 11 more years, a position he will hold until January. He was just elected to the Polk County Board of Supervisors, winning with 82% of the vote.\nWhitaker left his position as US attorney in 2009 and ran unsuccessfully for the US Senate in 2014. He also unsuccessfully vied for a seat on the Iowa Supreme Court, then went on to create the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, a Washington nonprofit funded almost entirely by dark money. In 2017, he became former Attorney General Jeff Sessions' chief of staff until this week, when he stepped into his former boss' job."

        "input": "When Donald Trump became the 45th president of the United States, it underlined the need for the wider world to understand exactly what was going on politically in the major superpower.\nThe London School of Economics\u2019 United States Centre responded by launching the State of the States, a free, apolitical online",
        "output": "resource giving in-depth information about each of the 50 US states, along with up-to-date information about policies and political developments drawn from local news sources and blogs.\nIt developed from the centre\u2019s US American Politics and Policy blog, where academics posted daily articles and book reviews on all aspects of US governance, economics, culture, politics and society. With Trump\u2019s victory relying on narrow margins in a handful of states, they felt that an understanding of trends in specific US states was needed to help predict future developments.\nUsing digital agency Soak to build the interactive aspects of the website, the team began data-gathering, bringing together more than 2,500 pieces of information and producing a prototype of the site, with the aim of making it as user-friendly as possible for those with no knowledge of US politics. Users click on a map of the US to access a mini-profile of each state, plus stats on the political makeup of the state senate and assembly, key political figures, representation in Congress, demographics, economy, healthcare and attitudes to policy areas ranging from capital punishment to cannabis.\nIt is also possible to search, by time period and state, for political updates on specific topics such as abortion, free speech, gun laws and trade unions.\nThe website launched on 6 November, the same day as the US midterm elections, and has been updated regularly since.\nThe LSE\u2019s South Asia Centre is now developing a similar interactive resource ahead of the Indian elections in 2019, and the State of the States will be the model for a future global electoral interactive overview being planned by the university\u2019s government department.\nMany universities have experimented with online degrees but Coventry has done so with spectacular gusto. In just 18 months, its provision of wholly online degree education has grown from nothing to reach 80,000 learners in 188 countries.\nCoventry University Online now delivers 12 degrees and 45 open courses, and the aim is that by 2022 the number of degree programmes will have increased to 50.\nCoventry launched its first online master\u2019s degree, in nursing, in January 2018, before adding a suite of further master\u2019s including construction management, cybersecurity, emergency management and organisational psychology. Students can take an online master\u2019s in business administration focusing on a specific specialism such as healthcare, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity management or sustainable tourism.\nThe university has also developed a postgraduate certificate in higher education practice for its staff across the world to study for an internationally recognised teaching qualification, and pre-sessional English provision for prospective students to improve their English language provision before undertaking further study.\nIt has partnered with the Open College Network London to deliver an open course in mental health targeted at school leavers, and with Deakin University in Melbourne, Australia to deliver a postgraduate certificate in entrepreneurship. The aim is \u201cto give people a ladder up to begin a degree or progress, not just complete one course and log off\u201d.\nThis rapid development was made possible by the university becoming the first UK higher education institution to partner with the social learning platform FutureLearn. It has also invested in a studio to create its own digital media, including video content and high-quality podcasts.\nBut flexibility has been key. Students are able to scale their studies up or down each semester according to their personal circumstances, using a pay-as-you-go financial model. They are also encouraged to \u201ctry before they buy\u201d by engaging in the first two-week course of each module, which is free, before enrolling on a full degree. Every course is suitable for PCs, tablets and mobile devices in low bandwidth areas.\nOnce signed up, students become part of a small cohort with access to a network of named tutors, learning coaches and technical support, and on graduation receive the same qualification as on-campus students.\nThe results have been as impressive as the rate of expansion, showing 96% retention and 85% student satisfaction.\nHow can universities respond to the demands of a large student body that expects answers on demand 24/7 without driving staff into the ground? The answer, for Staffordshire University, is artificial intelligence.\nBeacon is its new AI-driven chatbot \u2013 or digital coach and assistant \u2013 primed to support students with everything from remembering where their next lectures are to filling in council tax forms. The university estimates that within three weeks of being launched in January 2019, it had helped more students than a single member of staff would in a year.\nThe app recognises students when they log in and can respond either to text or voice. As well as being able to answer questions about timetabling, how to log in to university wifi, where to find something to eat or when the library opens, it can proactively suggest societies for students to join and events to attend, as well as prompting them about revision, giving them reminders about lectures and assignments, and notifying them of the next bus home.\nThe idea is that Beacon will become smarter the more students use it, offering personalised advice such as which books and study aids to use. It should also be able to step in when students\u2019 engagement appears to be waning, setting new goals for them to reach and reminding them to see a personal tutor.\nStaffordshire was the first university in Europe to migrate fully to cloud hosting, which has made digital innovation easier. It has laid out a digital vision for 2030, which includes the idea that over the next 10 years students will interact more with AI day-to-day than with any member of staff.\nStudents, academics and a development company with experience of AI all contributed to the Beacon project before its release. It is now one of the top apps in the App Store for education, and Staffordshire county council is exploring with the university how Beacon could also be used to support local school children."

But it also speaks volumes about Brazil, and its economy as a whole.\nBrazil saw protests earlier in the year, which demonstrated that people felt the last decade of economic growth had been wasted, with little investment made in infrastructure and education.\nBack in 2010, its economy expanded by 7.5 percent - thanks in large part to foreign investors and a credit and consumption boom. But now, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), its economy is barely eking out 2.5 percent growth, and the Central Bank has stepped in to raise interest rates in a bid to tame inflation.\nCarlos Caicedo, the principle Latin American analyst at IHS Country Risk in London, speaks to Counting the Cost about the Eike Batista story, while Al Jazeera's Gabriel Elizondo reports from Brazil.\nElsewhere, the big gold miners say they spend billions in developing nations, but with gold off its peak, how long will it last?\nAccountancy firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers estimates that gold mining contributed $78bn in gross economic value to the 15 leading gold producing countries, with the creation of 530,000 direct jobs.\nAnd the World Gold Council says its 15 members - all big mining corporations - spent $55bn last year in the countries they operate in.\nThat breaks down to $8.4bn in tax and royalty payments to governments, $35bn to local businesses, to provide essential services to mining operations, and $8.3bn to pay wages to the quarter of million people they employ.\nBut the price of gold has really fallen since 2012, which hurts the earnings of the big miners and, in turn, hurts the revenue of the developing nations where the gold comes from.\nSo how does it all balance out? Counting the Cost speaks to Terry Heymann, the director of Responsible Gold at the World Gold Council, to find out.\nGulf air carrier Qatar Airways has joined one of the world's big three airline alliances - the groupings which bring together airlines, connections, lounges etc - all, they say, for the convenience of the passenger.\nThe big three alliances are SkyTeam, Star Alliance, and oneworld, which is the alliance Qatar Airways joined. The oneworld alliance now has 13 member airlines, including big players like British Airways, American Airlines and Qantas, plus another three which are in the pipeline to join.\nCombined, it carries 475 million passengers a year to a thousand airports in over 150 countries. That translates into annual revenue of $150bn.\nBut for a long time Qatar Airways did not want to join any alliance - a view still held by the other major Gulf players, Etihad and Emirates, who want to keep more control over their own destiny.\nWe speak to Bruce Ashby, the CEO of the oneworld alliance, to discuss the recent move by Qatar Airways and whether it will pay off.\nFinally, we look at Ecuador, which is giving up on a controversial drilling plan in the Amazon.\nIt first wanted rich countries to pay it not to drill for oil in the rainforest, effectively saying they would not go after the oil riches if they were compensated not to do so.\nHowever, the government is allowing oil exploration in one of the most pristine parts of the country, and many people are unhappy about it.

        "output": "Court and the East African Court of Justice with the mandate to prosecute international crimes,\u201d Mr Jallow said at the recent West African Stakeholders\u2019 Consultation on Emerging Trends on Complementarity in Banjul.\nThis would help in burden sharing where the task was too great for the country of primary jurisdiction and ensure that the process of accountability occurred not far from the community directly affected, while respecting the principle of complementarity, he said.\nThe programme was organised by Africa Legal Aid (AFLA), a flagship non-governmental organisation on justice and accountability based in The Hague, in conjunction with the Attorney General\u2019s Chambers and the Ministry of Justice of The Gambia, and the Raoul Wallenberg Institute of Human Rights in Sweden.\nMembers of the Judiciary, prosecutors, civil societies, legal fraternities and victims of crimes of atrocity from West Africa attended.\nChief Justice Jallow said; \u201cThe current patchwork or mosaic of bilateral treaties on mutual legal assistance \u2013 some dating a century or more between states \u2013 does not facilitate cooperation between states in this field.\nHe said such a global or regional multilateral treaty would provide an ideal framework for cooperation in pursuit of global justice and accountability.\nMr Jallow, also a former Judge of the Appeals Chamber of the Special Court for Sierra Leone, and ex-prosecutor at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, said there were constant arguments over the role of the ICC in Africa, which felt hampered by the Court, as the Continent attempted to move forward with complementarity.\n\u201cIt is\u2026fitting that periodically we review the trends in complementarity and explore ways in which that fundamental principle of justice can be further strengthened.\n\u201cFor the future of justice and accountability lies ultimately on the extent to which we can give concrete reality to the principle of complementarity,\u201d he said.\nHe, however, acknowledged that weak national legal systems and overburdened international tribunals had given rise to fertile territory for impunity to flourish.\nIn that regard, Mr Jallow said he wanted to see states \u201cempowered \u2013 individually or collectively \u2013 to discharge their primary responsibility for the prosecution of serious crimes\u201d.\nEvelyn Ankumah, the Executive Director of AFLA, said: \u201cIn simple terms [complementarity] means that the ICC should not deal with a case if national or local criminal systems can and will deal with it.\nShe said international criminal justice should be pursued in the village, the province, the state or region where the crimes were committed, adding that The Hague was not the ideal place where international criminal justice should be first pursued.\n\u201cJustice should be done at home, or as close to home as possible,\u201d she added.\nMorten Kjaerum, of the Raoul Wallenberg Institute, said there were numerous setbacks to the prosecution of international crimes, which include \u201cthe tension between Africa and the Global North over prosecutions, and the lack of popular knowledge about the ICC, which makes people vulnerable to populist attacks on the Court and what it stands for\u201d.\nMr Kjaerum said consultations like the one in Banjul were crucial to strengthening the current efforts for the promotion of human rights and the global fight against impunity.\nHe said the exchange of promising practices and honest deliberations about hurdles and barriers could push the Continent forward, as she explored how to optimise the use of the current human rights landscape.\nThe Banjul Consultation was the first of a series of two regional meetings on complementarity in Africa, with the one for East and Central Africa scheduled for July in Kampala.\nSouthern Africa has been excluded because the Region does not appear to have issues with complementarity.\nMeanwhile, in a new report by the New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) looks at the extent to which the ICC can encourage domestic trials, avoiding the need for the Court to conduct its own investigations.\nThe report draws lessons from four case studies: Colombia, Georgia, Guinea, and the UK.\n\u201cTwenty years after the Rome Treaty, the ICC\u2019s burgeoning caseload and limited resources underscore the need for fair and effective domestic prosecutions,\u201d said Elizabeth Evenson, Associate International Justice Director at HRW.\nShe said more ICC member countries should support the prosecutor\u2019s efforts to encourage successful local proceedings, adding that the ICC prosecutor\u2019s office should tailor its approaches in each preliminary examination."

The team of both medical students",
        "output": "and geologists were able to piece together how kidney stones form, their changes through time, and how they can record the health of a person's kidney.\nThe research, published in Scientific Reports, upends our understanding of how kidney stones grow. Kidney stones grow much like coral reefs or stalagmites grow, adding sequential calcium carbonate layers on top of each other. In between growth cycles, kidney stones can also dissolve slightly, leaving gaps in their structure.\nIn geology, rocks can unlock clues to the environments they were exposed to. For example, a stalagmite grows in size by the slow drip of mineral-rich water in a cave. Each water droplet contains dissolved minerals, which precipitate out to add a tiny amount rock to a stalagmite.\nAs calcium carbonate layers form from the sequential drip of mineral-rich waters, trace elements within the water record changes in Earth's environment. For example, by analyzing the oxygen isotopes within the calcium carbonate layers, scientists can determine the precipitation record in the surrounding region.\nA 2,000-year-old stalagmite with layers of calcium carbonate corresponding to the wet and dry season each year. Scientists can detect tropical cyclones in these layers from very depleted levels of oxygen-18.\nMuch like these rocks, kidney stones grow through time, layer by layer and in doing so record the health of a person's kidneys. Kidney stones are primarily made up of calcium oxalate, which was previously thought to be insoluble within the kidney. However, through analyzing kidney stones using geological approaches, the team was able to identify dissolution zones within the crystals.\nThis indicates that the kidney stones both grow and dissolve as time passes. The breakthrough in understanding could lead to proactive measures to dissolve kidney stones instead of painfully passing or surgically removing the stones.\nA human kidney stone from the Mayo Clinic.\nThe research team concluded in their paper that kidney stones could be used to read a minute by minute history of a person's health, similar to how geologists read rock layers to understand past environments.\nBy investigating kidney stones under X-Ray spectroscopy and fluorescence microscopes, tools typically used in geology, the team was able to see unprecedented detail with resolutions up to 140 nanometers."

        "output": "they\u2019ve been blamed for, and how a new state law intended to crack down on them is \u2013 or isn\u2019t \u2013 working.\nKUSA - Randy and Linda Wimmer had 200 miles to go, cutting across U.S. 287 outside Memphis, Texas, when the phone buzzed and their lives were altered forever.\nIt was Sept. 30, 2018, and they were on their way home after visiting their son in Albuquerque. The call was about their 25-year-old daughter, Angela, a technician at an optical center in Lakewood.\n\u201cThe policemen said that she'd been in a car accident, that she was in surgery and she was having brain surgery,\u201d Linda Wimmer said as she and Randy sat in their rural home on the plains northwest of Dallas and talked about the oldest of their three daughters, the second of their children.\nNone of it made sense to them. Angela had just bought a new Mazda sedan the day before \u2013 her first brand new car \u2013 and exchanged playful text messages with them earlier that morning. Angela, they knew, was headed to mass. What happened?\nAngela Wimmer was 25 years old when she was killed in a car crash.

They would find themselves overwhelmed with grief, their daughter killed in a crash that police and prosecutors blamed on a man with six prior convictions for drinking and driving. A man, according to court documents obtained by 9Wants to Know, who had a blood-alcohol level more than four times the legal limit 90 minutes after the crash.\nRepeat drunken drivers are nothing new in Colorado \u2013 a man named Richard Strock killed his ex-wife in a 2005 crash along Interstate 70. It was his 19th drunken driving arrest, according to court documents and Colorado Bureau of Investigation records.\nA four-month 9Wants to Know investigation, which included the examination of police and court records from multiple jurisdictions, found that a similar pattern played out for Grudznske in DUI case after case: He was allowed to plead guilty to the lowest possible crime while other charges, such as driving with a with a revoked license or driving without insurance, were dismissed.\nWhen he failed to follow through on the requirements of those deals \u2013 by going to alcohol classes, performing public service or staying out of trouble \u2013 he was given chance after chance, those documents show. An examination of every criminal court case involving Grudznske over nearly two decades found 10 instances when he could have had his probation revoked for failing to follow the terms of a plea deal \u2013 but it wasn\u2019t.\nWhen probation finally was revoked in one case, the judge gave him a do-over \u2013 starting the same requirements anew.\nIn another case, a judge finally just canceled his probation after he didn\u2019t complete it, then lumped a jail sentence together with what he was serving in another case.\nThe Sunday morning that was Sept. 30 was warm and sunny in the Denver area. Angela\u2019s new Mazda still had some of the factory tags on it as she headed out to church \u2013 she was a devout Catholic, and Sunday morning mass was part of her routine.\nShe did not know Todd Grudznske, a 47-year-old tree trimmer who came to Colorado from Wisconsin, although they lived less than a mile from each other. Both of their homes were along Miller Street west of Kipling Street.\nThat same morning, Grudznske headed out, wearing a Green Bay Packers jersey, and stopped at three separate bars, according to court documents and the court testimony of Lakewood police officers Jim Moffat, Jason Ezell, Jeromy Rohling and Gregory Strandberg.\nThis surveillance photo shows Todd Grudznske in a bar before he was allegedly involved in the fatal crash that killed Angela Wimmer, police said.\nStrangberg testified at Grudznske\u2019s preliminary hearing that his morning began sometime around 9 a.m. at Swig Tavern, 11810 W. Colfax Ave., where investigators allege that over approximately an hour he downed a beer and three shots of Rumple Minze. Then, according to Strandberg, he headed off to another bar, Tavern on 26th, 10040 W. 26th Ave., which is operated by his landlord, according to Colorado Liquor Enforcement Division records. He didn\u2019t stay long, but while he was there he had a beer and a shot of tequila, Strandberg testified.\nGrudznske arrived at Misfits Sports Bar & Grill, 11475 W. Colfax Ave., at 10:57 a.m. Three minutes after walking in, he ordered his first beer, according to Strandberg. A little later, a shot of whiskey. Then another beer. Then more shots. At one point, he sent over a round of shots to other Packers fans; Strandberg said investigators believe Grudznske may have done shots with that group.\nAt 12:39 p.m., Grudznske stood and walked out. The tally at Misfits: two beers, and at least five shots of whiskey \u2013 Wild Turkey and Jameson, Strandberg testified.\nHis total consumption over the previous 3\u00bd hours, as alleged by Lakewood police: four beers and nine shots (three Rumple Minze, one tequila, five whiskey).\nWhat officers testify Todd Grudznske drank before he was allegedly involved in a fatal crash.The final tally was four beers and nine shots.\nAround the same time, Angela Wimmer was headed south on Kipling toward her home. She was a couple minutes away when she stopped at a red light at Colfax Avenue. She was the only southbound vehicle at the light.\nPolice would later conclude that Grudznske\u2019s gold Chevy pickup, its bed overflowing with tree limbs, was headed down Kipling at between 68 and 71 mph before its speed dropped as it approached Colfax, Rohling, one of the officers, testified in court. Suddenly, the truck plowed into Angela\u2019s car \u2013 investigators put the truck\u2019s speed at the moment of impact at between 58 and 64 mph, Rohling testified. The impact was so powerful it launched Wimmer\u2019s car into the intersection \u2013 just a quarter second after the crash, she was careening across the pavement at 44 mph.\nThere were no pre-impact skidmarks left by the truck, according to court documents.\nTraffic camera video shows the moments before and after the fatal crash.\nAngela\u2019s Mazda smashed into another vehicle, and two more cars got caught up in the chain-reaction wreck.\nUp the road, Becky Shorey was approaching the intersection, headed to a home center.\n\u201cI saw a bunch of smoke, steam, something, up ahead just past the intersection, which caught my attention,\u201d said Shorey, a teacher and former EMT. \u201cAnd then I looked and I saw cars in the intersection; everybody was stopped.\nThen she went to the pickup, where a man in a Packers jersey was at the wheel, bloody, and appeared to be attempting to get away.\nFirst responders speak to Todd Grudznske in the moments after the crash.\nEventually, she left, but not before stopping for a moment where paramedics were working on Angela.\n\u201cI knew that she was in real trouble and she would be lucky to survive,\u201d Shorey said.\nAngela died at the hospital, a little more than two hours after the crash.\nGrudznske\u2019s six prior drinking and driving convictions made him a candidate for a felony DUI charge \u2013 a new law enacted in 2015. It makes it a felony to be convicted of drinking and driving more than three times.\nIn addition to his six prior convictions, 9Wants to Know found three other instances in which Grudznske was suspected or reported to have been drinking and driving \u2013 but he wasn\u2019t charged with DUI in any of those cases.\nThere was a 2004 case in Lakewood in which an officer pulled him over because his license plates weren\u2019t valid, later learning that his license was revoked because he\u2019d been deemed a habitual traffic offender.\nA composite of Todd Grudznske's past mugshots.\nMost records in the case have been destroyed, and it is not clear whether the officer asked Grudznske to perform roadside tests or give a sample of his blood or breath to see if he was impaired or intoxicated. John Romero, Lakewood police spokesman, said he could not answer questions about how the case was handled because there aren\u2019t documents to detail what happened.\nThere was the case in 2011 in which a woman called 911 and reported an erratic driver near Kipling Street and 44th Avenue. She provided a license number, and officers traced it to the woman Grudznske was married to at the time, going to the couple\u2019s home to investigate.\nBut when officers questioned Grudznske, he claimed he hadn\u2019t had anything to drink until after he\u2019d gotten home. The man he was with that day denied they\u2019d been drinking.\nIn the end, police charged Grudznske with evading an interlock device \u2013 his own vehicle had the machine installed that required him to pass a breath test before it could be started, something he was required by a court to do. His wife\u2019s car didn\u2019t have the device installed.\nThere was also a case in July 2017 where a man called police to report that a couple was fighting in front of his home. The couple was Grudznske and his estranged girlfriend, according to Jefferson County Sheriff\u2019s Office reports. The woman told officers that they\u2019d been at a bar drinking and were returning to her house \u2013 with Grudznske at the wheel \u2013 when he physically assaulted her. By the time the officers arrived, he was nowhere to be found.\nHe was arrested in that case more than a week later.\nTodd Grudznske's mugshot after he was involved in a crash on Sept. 30.\nIn the wake of the Sept. 30 crash, Grudznske faces charges of first-degree murder, three counts of attempted first-degree murder, first-degree assault, vehicular homicide-DUI, vehicular homicide-reckless driving, three counts of attempted first-degree assault, felony DUI, violation of a protection order, and reckless driving as well as two counts of committing a crime of violence, a sentencing enhancer.\nHis blood-alcohol level, according to court documents obtained by 9Wants to Know, was .341 at 1:49 p.m. \u2013 a little more than an hour after the crash. That\u2019s more than four times the level of .08 at which a motorist in Colorado is considered intoxicated.\nGrudznske has pleaded not guilty to all charges and is being held without bail. He is scheduled to go on trial June 3.\nIn addition, prosecutors have begun the process of trying to revoke his probation in the 2017 domestic violence case on the allegation that by drinking he violated the requirements imposed in his plea deal.\nGrudznske denied a 9NEWS request for an interview.\nRandy and Linda Wimmer spoke to 9NEWS about the loss of their daughter.\nBecky Shorey, who came upon the crash in Lakewood moments after it happened, is bothered by the idea that Grudznske was still on the road with his history of DUI convictions.\nIt\u2019s a question that Randy and Linda Wimmer wrestle also with.\nAngela Wimmer was laid to rest at age 25 after she was hit and killed by a man who police said was driving drunk.\nRandy Wimmer told 9NEWS he believes that people should be denied the right to drive after one or two DUIs \u2013 but he also acknowledges that is easier said than done.\nAnd there\u2019s the pain of the loss.\nAngela Wimmer's mom called her death the worst thing that has ever happened to her.\nBlood-alcohol content or breath-alcohol content: Both are commonly referred to as BAC. Each is a measurement of weight against volume. When blood is tested, the results are expressed as a measurement of grams of alcohol in 100 milliliters of blood. When breath is tested, the results are expressed as grams of alcohol in 210 liters of breath.\nDriving while ability Impaired: Commonly referred to as DWAI, it is the lowest-level charge that can be filed against someone accused of drinking and driving. A person is presumed to be DWAI with a BAC of .05 to .08 while driving. It is a misdemeanor and a conviction can carry a sentence of up to 180 days in jail.\nDriving under the influence: Commonly referred to as DUI, it is the more serious of the two charges most often filed against someone accused of drinking and driving. A person is presumed to be DUI with a BAC of .08 or higher while driving. It is a misdemeanor and a conviction can carry a sentence of up to 1 year in jail.\nUnder 21 drinking and driving: A person under age 21 can be charged with drinking and driving with a blood-alcohol level between .02 and .05. It is a traffic infraction.\nFelony DUI: A new law passed by the Colorado Legislature and signed by then-Gov. John Hickenlooper in 2015 made it a felony to be convicted of DWAI or DUI for a fourth or subsequent time. A conviction can carry a prison term of up to six years.\nExpressed consent: Anyone who drives in Colorado is presumed to have expressed the consent to submit to roadside tests or a blood or breath test to check for intoxication if requested by a law officer who has probable cause to suspect that person has been drinking and driving."

Clashes between right-wing protesters and leftists resulted in some 20 people being injured, according to the police. At that time, Seehofer said he would join the protesters if he was not a minister.\nAnother point of contention was Seehofer\u2019s support for Hans-Georg Maassen, chief of Germany\u2019s domestic security agency, who said that he was \u201cskeptical\u201d about media reports of right-wing extremists chasing down foreigners during the protests in Chemnitz.

Apart from Chemnitz, a new series of protests was triggered last weekend in the city of Kothen, where a man died after a scuffle with a group of Afghans.

        "output": "is not really pudding, but blood sausage), and you\u2019re also probably going to feel better. And so it goes.\nOn that note, one of my favorite international breakfast hangover cures is the Filipino \u201csilog\u201d plate, a plate of toasted garlic rice, a fried egg and different cured meats. It\u2019s like a Filipino version of DIY Chinese fried rice or Korean bibimbap. The meat choices are endless: There\u2019s bacsilog (which includes bacon), chiksilog (which includes fried chicken) and even hotsilog (which includes, yep, hot dog).\nMy favorite is tosilog, aka silog with cured pork belly, which is usually crispy on the outside, silky on the inside and coated in a gooey candied crust. Because a lot of Chicago Filipino restaurants serve their food in steam tables, you don\u2019t often see a lot of silog offered \u2014 a fried egg or even bacon isn\u2019t going to hold well moldering away over constant heat.\nGrill City inside Seafood City, the gigantic Filipino supermarket, serves a decent selection. Uncle Mike\u2019s in West Town does a nice version with a pungent vinegar-kissed tomato and onion salsa on the weekends.\nBut, even when it\u2019s offered, tocino (cured pork) can also be chewy and an unnatural shade of red that taps into worries about food dye.\nAnd that is why I like the tocilog at Kubo ($11). It\u2019s fundamentally different. There is no dye. Instead of pork belly, it features hunks of tender pork shoulder coated in a sticky molasses-like sauce that features burnt caramel notes from a pineapple, brown sugar, onion and garlic-infused glaze. The salty fried egg and the heady garlic perfume off the rice lull you into a sated trance.\nKubo was launched by owner Christine Ledesma, a Filipino chef who grew up in the city of Bacolod and immigrated to Chicago in 1999. The restaurant is an attempt to introduce Americans to an Asian cuisine in the shadows of Chinese or Thai food. Toward that end, Ledesma opened Kubo in Lakeview and has branded traditional dishes like Lumpia Shanghai \u201cskinny egg rolls\u201d ($8) and grilled adobo barbecue pork as \u201csweetie pork on a stick\u201d ($7).\nDespite the more accessible names, the cooking is pretty authentic, especially a bowl of kansi soup ($18) that\u2019s so soulful it offers another great hangover cure."

        "output": "revealed at least 160 horse deaths at the Charles Town Races track in West Virginia since 2014. Though the rate of horse deaths at Charles Town is nearly average the rate of thoroughbred breakdowns nationwide, the investigation also detailed dozens of positive drug tests by horses at Charles Town and an ongoing dispute over the positioning of race stewards at the track by the West Virginia Racing Commission.\nThe I-Team\u2019s report raises questions about whether the feds should order the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency to provide nationwide oversight of the use of medications in the industry, U.S. Humane Society Chief Executive Officer Wayne Pacelle said.\nThe Humane Society is part of a coalition advocating for a new federal law. The coalition includes former Maryland Jockey Club Chief Executive Officer Joe DeFrancis, who said the industry needs a national governing body.\nThe congressional bill providing authority to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, House Resolution 3084, was formally introduced in 2015. In a statement to News4, the National Horsemen\u2019s Benevolent and Protective Association was critical of the proposal.\n\u201cThe path to national medication uniformity in horse racing is not through an additional layer of bureaucracy, but rather working together through appropriate research,\u201d the statement said.\nDrug tests nationwide show only a small percentage of violations, according to the organization, and the industry is already working on uniform standards.\n\u201cRules will rapidly be adopted by regulators across all jurisdictions, negating the need for federal legislation,\u201d the statement said.\nOther industry organizations have not yet taken firm positions on the bill.\nRep. Joe Pitts (R-Pa.) said the findings of the I-Team\u2019s report were troubling.\nPitts has sponsored a separate bill in Congress to outlaw the use of race day medications.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the solution, with severe penalties for those who don\u2019t abide by those standards,\u201d he said.\nThe 160 deaths reviewed by the I-Team include a freak and tragic incident in December 2014 in which a horse stumbled, lost its jockey, then broke free in the wrong direction, triggering a head-on collision with other thoroughbreds on the track.\nAn investigation into the incident ordered by the West Virginia Racing Commission recommended changes in safety protocols to prevent future mishaps, including a recommendation that a state racing steward watch future races with binoculars from an outdoor position along an elevated rail above the grandstand. The investigation found the stewards were instead watching the December 2014 race on a TV monitor from inside a glass-enclosed booth when the incident occurred.\nThe I-Team review of multiple races at Charles Town in the year since the recommendation was issued found stewards are continuing to watch races exclusively from inside the glass-enclosed booth, not out on the railing with binoculars. During 12 races viewed by the I-Team, racing stewards watched the race from the recommended position on the railing zero times.\nThe stewards would be better positioned to see wrong-way horses and other safety hazards by watching races live along the outdoor rail, Charles Town Races operations manager Erich Zimny said.\n\u201cClearly in that incident there were a number of failures that allowed the tragic situation to play out,\u201d Pacelle said. \u201cThey should have taken steps to fix that problem, and it's disappointing that they haven't done so.\""

But as a young man, Woitschek was once a medical assistant sent to assist the German administration established in Saipan. He arrived in 1899.\nIn short: Woitschek married a local woman, Soledad Cepeda, and they had a son Juan Cepeda. They eventually split, and Woitschek then married Antonia Palacios Cabrera, with whom he had three children: Asuncion Cabrera Blanco, Rosa Cabrera Tudela and August Cabrera. Woitschek was forced to leave his family behind when Germany recalled its nationals, whose Pacific presence was being threatened at the time by Japan.\nIn Germany, Woitschek remarried and had a son, Helmut, who had an only child, Erika Woitschek who became Erika Entenmann.\nThe reunion, held over the last two weeks, is the story of how the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of Hermann Woitschek. in Europe and in the Marianas, found each other.\nEntenmann said she always knew her father had family somewhere in the Pacific, possibly near Papua New Guinea. Her grandfather had told her stories as a little girl, she said, and she yearned to reconnect with them some way. For years, she wondered, and then she started looking.\nIn October 2016, she came across an article from the Saipan Tribune, which mentioned a meeting commemorating the German administration a century before. It mentioned her grandfather, a daughter and granddaughter.\n\"It was so shocking. We had known all the time he has children somewhere by Papua New Guinea. And now I found her name and a place where I could find her,\" said Entenmann. \"I began to search at many different places. Ancestry and other root pages. I researched in old books about this time. And the Internet!\"\nEntenmann said she sent more 100 inquires to different people, stating her last name and asking if they were related. Most said no, but tried to help. Entenmann is normally a shy person, but felt compelled to keep searching.\n\"It was so important to me. Because I knew now, the family was looking for information about grandpa, what happened and why he did not come back,\" said Entenmann. \"I feel that they all have to think, they were not loved because he is leaving. I know I cannot change what happened, but if they know, they will not forget, they are a little bit lighter. And also give the chance to know what happened after he left the islands.\"\nFinally, she made a connection with Cynthia Pangelinan, a great-granddaughter. Afterward, the floodgates opened and she reconnected with dozens of relatives, and a handful of her remaining first cousins, the grandchildren of her grandfather's first two wives.\nEntenmann arrived on Saipan Dec. 7 and first hugged her cousin Sally Villanueva. The tears came and flowed and it would be a long time before they stopped.\n\"Unforgettable. Both of us we cried. It was so emotional,\" said Entenmann.\nWoitschek's family in Saipan had searched just as long, even seeking the help of a German radio station, to no avail.\nAs Entenmann met more and more relatives, she realized that the great-grandchildren had similar features to her grandfather, and some had blue eyes, fair skinned, or were unusually tall.\n\"I was also impressed by how many identify with their origins. Some have tattooed their name, Boischit, That's how they wrote Woitschek,\" said Entenmann. \"I was a little child, when grandpa tell me stories about his life here. Now I am here, I see with my own eyes where he lived for 17 years, and I saw the family, who missed him a lot.\n\"And I know he missed his children, too. To make the contact and put the things together, that makes me really happy.\"\nEntenmann recently arrived on Guam to meet even more family. Ramona C. Siblang, one of Woitschek's great-granddaughters and the granddaughter of his firs-tborn, Juan Cepeda, is here organizing the reunion party at Gov. Joseph Flores Park, at Ypao beach.\n\"All my life I've been searching to find out more about my great-grandfather Hermann and longing to find my family in Germany. I was close to my grandfather Juan but I was so little when he passed away and could not find anyone who can give me answers,\" she said. \"As a little girl I've spoken to my great-grandfather's other children Tan Rosa and Tan Chong but even they could not remember much except for his first name. It's been so heart warming and I'm filled with tears of joy to finally meet my auntie Erika and most especially to see so many pictures and learn so much more about my great-grandfather. I can now share the stories and the history to my children and grandchildren.\"\nEntenmann and her daughter Eva leave Guam Sunday for four days in Palau before returning home.\n\"I know, that many of my relatives are living here, that is the reason I am here,\" said Entenmann. \"I am normally not travelling around the world, and the heat is not so much for me!\""

But for the school year, Spight said the School of Undergraduate Studies increased its number of First-year Interest Groups from 15 to 23 to help handle the greater number of students. The school is also trying to add a Transfer Interest Group to provide similar services to transfer students.\nDespite UGS receiving a bulk of the increase, Spight said this was something that is going to positively affect schools and colleges.\nNew Student Services, the division that runs orientation programs, is also dealing with the increase in student enrollment. The campus is currently hosting about 1,200 freshmen at its first orientation session. Kyle Clark, assistant director of New Student Services, said while the University has handled large orientations before, each orientation will be at maximum capacity.\n\u201cSo far, this has not presented any challenges for us that were unforeseen,\u201d Clark said.\nWhile UGS and NSS have taken measures to deal with the incoming class, the Division of Housing and Food Services and UT\u2019s Federal Work-Study program are not anticipating the class size to cause problems.\nLaurie Mackey, director of DHFS, said housing has more requests than room availability every year, but they are always able to fill every housing request by the end of summer. UT does not require incoming freshmen to live on campus, something several Universities across the country mandate.\nMackey also said the increase will not be a problem for dining centers.\nAnd Linda Morgan, student employment supervisor for the work-study program, said students will still be able to find jobs on campus, through work-study or otherwise. Morgan said work-study is stressing this to students at orientation. Last semester, there were 7,000 undergraduate students who worked on campus and only 1,000 of them were hired through work-study.\n\u201cIf students want to work then by golly, they\u2019re going to work,\u201d Morgan said."

Hargrove, now with Green Bay, was suspended eight games, while Fujita, now with Cleveland, was suspended three games.\nThe NFL Players Association issued a statement saying it will continue to pursue all options.\n\"The players are disappointed with the League's conduct during this process,\" the statement said. \"We reiterate our concerns about the lack of fair due process, lack of integrity of the investigation and lack of the jurisdictional authority to impose discipline under the collective bargaining agreement.\n\"Moreover, the Commissioner took actions during this process that rendered it impossible for him to be an impartial arbitrator.\"\nGoodell said he did not take his initial decision lightly and also points out that players did not help their cause by refusing to participate fully in the appeal process.\nVilma and his attorney, Peter Ginsberg, walked out of the hearing early after Ginsberg raised his objections to the NFL's handling of the entire investigation. The other three players, who were represented by NFL Players Association attorneys, sat through the hearing to observe the NFL's presentation of evidence, but in protest refused to present any evidence or witnesses of their own, and did not question the NFL investigators who were present at the hearing.\n\"Although you claimed to have been `wrongfully accused with insufficient evidence,' your lawyers elected not to ask a single question of the principal investigators, both of whom were present at the hearing,\" Goodell wrote in his appeal ruling. \"You elected not to testify or to make any substantive statement, written or oral, in support of your appeal; you elected not to call a single witness to support your appeal; and you elected not to introduce a single exhibit addressing the merits of your appeal. Instead, your lawyers raised a series of jurisdictional and procedural objections that generally ignore\" the collective bargaining agreement.\nThe NFL issued a report in March saying that league investigators determined the Saints ran a bounty program from 2009 to 2011 that offered improper cash payments for hits that injured targeted opponents.\nThe league has said former Saints defensive coordinator Gregg Williams ran the program, and that general manager Mickey Loomis and head coach Sean Payton failed to put a stop to it despite warnings from the NFL at the end of the 2009 season.\nThe NFL has suspended Williams indefinitely and Payton for the whole season. Loomis is suspended the first half of next season, while Saints assistant head coach Joe Vitt was suspended for the first six games. Goodell also docked the Saints second-round draft picks this year and next and fined the club $500,000.\n\"That this news was announced at 4 p.m. ET the day before the Fourth of July could be perceived as the league attempting to bury the news of the appeals,\" writes CBSSports.com's Will Brinson. \"But it's hardly surprising to anyone that Goodell decided to shrug off the Saints appeals.\""

        "output": "far has refrained from directly accusing the Iranian government.\nThe Iranians then agreed to conduct a joint investigation with the Turks on the validity of these allegations - a move that was welcomed in Ankara.\n\"Iran may categorically deny this information, but there is evidence supporting it,\" Mr. Demirel told a parliamentary group on Tuesday. \"If in fact the state [in Iran] is not involved, who is? Iran has an obligation to cooperate with us to unearth the facts.... Iran has a responsibility in this matter, if she does not want a deterioration in our relations.\"\nIn a similar message to Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani, Demirel urged Iran to investigate the activities said to be conducted inside Iran in support of Turkish militants, and warned that if this is not done \"relations between the two countries would be overshadowed\" by Iran's noncooperation.\nThe allegations follow the Jan. 24 murder of a prominent Turkish journalist, Ugur Mumcu, and an abortive assassination attempt on Jack Kamhi, a leading Turkish industrialist and prominent member of Turkey's Jewish community. Later investigation of these terrorist acts led to the discovery of the Islamic Action organization and the arrest of several members. Those arrested have since been linked to other killings.\nThe crackdown on the Islamic terrorist network was announced by Interior Minister Ismet Sezgin. \"In the light of the evidence it is clear that those who committed these murders had connections with Iran,\" he said. He added that there were strong indications that the pro-Iranian Turkish terrorists had contacts with the Iranian secret service Savama.\nMr. Sezgin's assertions and other statements made by police spokesmen come at a time when anti-Iranian feelings are spreading in Turkey. The death of Mumcu, a prominent investigative journalist who criticized Islamic fundamentalism and defended Ankara's secular system, led to massive demonstrations throughout the country.\nDays before the allegations by the authorities on the Iranian connection, the Turkish press carried reports and furious comments about Iran's involvement in trying to \"export the Islamic revolution\" to this country.\nDespite the strong turnout for pro-secular demonstrations, a backlash by pro-fundamentalist Turkish groups is expected.\nNeomettin Erbakan, leader of the pro-Islamic Welfare Party, has accused the authorities of lying about the recent killings. In his view, it is the US Central Intelligence Agency, Israel's Mossad agency, and other Western imperialists who are behind the efforts to destablize Turkey. This theme has found support with pro-fundamentalist publications and radical youth.\nSuch support for Iranian-style politics has prompted Ankara to keep this dispute contained. \"We must act on this matter cautiously and cooly,\" Demirel told his parliamentarians.\nTurkish diplomats say that while Turkey and Iran pursue separate foreign policy goals regarding Central Asia and have different ideologies, they share common interests.\nDespite the current crisis, Turkish and Iranian foreign ministers met their Syrian counterpart in Damascus yesterday to coordinate policy on neighboring Iraq. A previous meeting, hosted by Turkey, was held to discuss Kurdish autonomy in Iraq's northern region, a source of common concern for Iraq's three neighbors.\nFor now, these common interests will bind Turkey and Iran into a constructive relationship, observers say. The ties explain the Turkish reluctance to blame Iran directly for official or unofficial support for Islamic radicals in Turkey.\nDiscussing his meeting with the Iranian foreign minister, the Turkish Foreign Minister Cetin said, \"I told him that such issues should not be permitted to harm our relations. But I also made it clear that terrorism is an issue of top priority to Turkey.\""

That mysterious surge of donations outpaced all contributions to Romney during the previous year from the wealthy Palm Beach area, when the campaign collected $270,000 over nine months. Romney got $21,000 more from residents there in February.\nUnlike President Barack Obama, Romney\ufffds campaign will not identify his major fundraisers, and federal law doesn\ufffdt require him to. The AP identified several of Romney\ufffds \ufffdbundlers\ufffd through interviews, finance records, event invitations and other publicity about campaign events. The lack of transparency by the Romney campaign prevents voters from knowing who wields influence inside the GOP frontrunner\ufffds campaign and how their interests might benefit if he is elected. Romney is in California this week for at least five private fundraisers.\nBundlers are typically well-connected business and banking executives who tap their professional and social networks to steer individual contributions from others to the campaign in amounts that can range from $10,000 to well over $500,000. Experienced bundlers can reach these highest amounts quickly.

Obama\ufffds re-election campaign has raised just over $151 million. His campaign released the names of its bundlers in late January, and the list illustrates how important these elite fundraisers have become. More than 440 bundlers collected at least $75 million to help Obama win a second term, including 61 people who each raised at least half-million dollars.\nFundraising has been a bright spot for Romney during the bruising GOP primary. Romney has built a potent organization that has pulled in nearly $75 million. Two-thirds of the total \ufffd nearly $49 million \ufffd came from people who gave the $2,500 maximum, which can be indicative of contributions pulled together by bundlers. Just $6.5 million, or 9 percent, came from supporters who gave $200 or less. The emphasis on top-tier donations indicates an active network of fundraisers who are targeting high-end contributors.\nOne prominent Romney supporter, Lewis M. Eisenberg, said that even with the rise of super PACs like Restore Our Future, which helped Romney pay for important advertising, the campaign is still dependent as ever on \ufffdhard money\ufffd that pays for salaries, state organizing, television ads, direct mailings and other expenses."

(When it came to the perception of outsiders, \u201carchitect\u2019s wife\u201d trumped \u201carchitect.\u201d) Venturi asked that Scott Brown be included in the award and was told that would not be possible. The couple decided that he had to accept the honor, because their firm was struggling financially, and the hundred-thousand-dollar award and the recognition would help enormously. At the ceremony, held at a palace in Mexico City, Venturi ended his acceptance speech with a forceful acknowledgment of Scott Brown\u2019s \u201ccrucial\u201d contributions. Scott Brown didn\u2019t attend.\nA few weeks ago, students at Harvard\u2019s Graduate School of Design (G.S.D.) decided to try to right the twenty-two-year-old wrong. Inspired by a recent interview with Scott Brown, they started a petition, demanding that she be \u201cretroactively acknowledged for her work deserving of a joint Pritzker Prize.\u201d The petition has now drawn more than eight thousand signatures, including Venturi, MOMA\u2019s Paola Antonelli, Harvard Dean of the G.S.D. Mohsen Mostafavi, as well as Pritzker winners Rem Koolhaas, Jacques Herzog, Pierre de Meuron, Wang Shu, and Zaha Hadid, the first woman to be given the award, more than two decades after its founding. The petition has drawn the Pritzker into a discussion of the profession\u2019s well-earned reputation for sexism, but also raised questions about the way the field\u2014and particularly the Pritzker\u2014traffics in a dated notion of the architect as romantic hero, inspired in isolation with plans for a shining monument. \u201cThe fact that one of the most creative and productive partnerships we have ever seen in architecture was separated rather than celebrated by a prize has been an embarrassing injustice which it would be great to undo,\u201d wrote Koolhaas when he signed the petition.\nScott Brown came to America in 1958, and in 1960 she met Venturi at a University of Pennsylvania faculty meeting. They shared many interests: social responsibility, maverick thought, Italian culture and architecture, especially mannerism. Two years later, they were teaching courses together. He told her about insights from Princeton\u2019s Donald Drew Egbert; she encouraged him to go deep into Edwin Lutyens. They scanned each other\u2019s reading lists, critiqued each other\u2019s writing and drawing, argued with and inspired each other. Their work became the joint product. Scott Brown joined his firm in 1967, the year they were married, and became a partner in 1969.\nTheir colleagues could be just as boorish. Philip Johnson, the founder of the Department of Architecture and Design at the MOMA and for a long time architecture\u2019s crown prince, used to hold regular black-tie dinners at the men-only Century Club for his favorite acolytes. Venturi was invited; \u201cthe wives\u201d were decidedly not welcome. (The first Pritzker, awarded in 1979, went to Johnson.) About three years ago, Scott Brown started to think about the idea of an \u201cinclusion ceremony,\u201d some kind of official Pritzker function to acknowledge her role and, more importantly, signal that architecture now welcomes all worthy practitioners and understands that creativity can come in many forms and in groups larger than one. A few weeks ago, the British Architects\u2019 Journal filmed an interview with Scott Brown, sitting in an armchair at home, in which she mentioned the idea. Arielle Assouline-Lichten, a student at Harvard\u2019s Graduate School of Design, was moved to start the petition, and Caroline James, a fellow G.S.D. student who\u2019d been inspired by Sheryl Sandberg\u2019s feminist manifesto \u201cLean In\u201d to restart a campus group for women in architecture, joined her in spreading the word on social media.\nIt\u2019s not clear what the Pritzker jury will decide. The Pritzker is chosen every year by a panel of independent jurors, which Martha Thorne, the prize\u2019s executive director, said, \u201cpresents us with an unusual situation\u201d This year\u2019s jury will discuss what to do when they meet in May, she said.\nPhotograph, of Denise Scott Brown and Robert Venturi, by Mel Evans/AP."

        "output": "voted Monday that Gilead's Sovaldi represents a \"low value\" treatment, considering its cost compared with older drugs for the blood-borne virus.\nThe vote was part of a broader review of new hepatitis C drugs by the California Technology Assessment Forum, an insurance industry-affiliated group that assesses the costs and effectiveness of new medical treatments. The group is expected to issue a final report next month on Sovaldi and another new hepatitis C drug, Olysio from Johnson & Johnson.\nDoctors have long sought more effective, palatable treatments for hepatitis C, the liver-destroying virus carried by an estimated 3 million to 4 million Americans. Until late last year, the standard treatments required taking up to 12 pills a day, alongside injections that can cause flu-like symptoms, an approach which only cured about 75 percent of patients.\nGilead Sciences' drug, launched in December, was quickly embraced by physicians based on its once-a-day pill regimen and increased effectiveness, curing between 80% and 90% of patients.\nBut some patients groups and health providers are beginning to question the cost of that benefit.\nIn January, the AIDS Healthcare Foundation urged state Medicaid providers to deny coverage for the drug until Gilead agrees to lower the price. The group, which provides HIV testing and prevention services, argues that Sovaldi's price \"will unnecessarily drive up health care costs and limit access to potentially lifesaving care.\"\n\"AHF believes that the price Gilead is charging for Sovaldi is not remotely justified. For one, it is exponentially more expensive than medications for other severe chronic conditions.\" The group notes that Sovaldi costs 1,100% more than Gilead's most expensive HIV drug, Stribild, which costs $80 per pill.\nAbout 25% of people with HIV infection are also infected with hepatitis C. And patients with both viruses are more likely to be enrolled in Medicaid, the state-federal health plan for the poor.\nIn a review released ahead of Monday's meeting, the California Technology Assessment Forum estimated that replacing currently used hepatitis C drugs with Gilead's Sovaldi would raise California drug costs between $18 billion and $29 billion per year, including both government and private insurer costs.\nGilead has said that the drug's costs will be recouped over the long term as fewer patients suffer liver failure and transplant complications. But the California group's assessment concludes that even after 20 years, reduced health care spending on hepatitis complications would only cover about two-thirds of the Sovaldi's upfront costs.\nAt Monday's meeting the panel of experts from California universities and hospitals voted that Sovaldi and J&J's Olysio are superior medical treatments to older therapies from Merck & Co and Vertex Pharmaceuticals. But considering their costs and benefits, a majority of panelists said that both of the new drugs deliver a \"low value.\" Olysio costs about $66,000 for one course of treatment.\nThe experts recommended the drugs should be used only for patients with severe hepatitis complications, such as liver cirrhosis.\nThe California Technology Assessment Forum was funded for more than 50 years by California Blue Shield but was recently incorporated into the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, a Boston-based research group funded by insurers, drugmakers and academic institutions. The group's board of directors includes executives from Blue Shield of California, Avalere Health, UnitedHealth Group and the Pacific Business Group on Health.\nGilead Sciences did not send a representative to Monday's meeting, but a company spokeswoman noted that it offers financial assistance to patients who cannot afford the drug and related insurance costs.\n\"Over time, we expect that treatment guidelines and the medical science will be what guides the discussion around treatment for a very serious liver disease -- not the potential short-term budget impact,\" said Cara Miller, in a statement. The company has noted that many private insurers are already covering the drug under their formularies.\nWall Street analysts estimate Sovaldi could garner sales of up to $8 billion this year alone, which would make it among the best-selling pharmaceutical products in the world.\nA spokesman for J&J's Janssen Pharmaceuticals said the panel's vote and conversation recognized Olysio \"as an important treatment option for patients living with chronic hepatitis C.\""

        "output": "world\u2019s oldest and most prestigious art biennial, the Venice Biennale. Every two years, artists from around the world showcase their work in scores of venues \u2014 some national pavilions sponsored by countries from around the globe; others international or independent exhibits. High art may seem a rarified field when the world is consumed by war, climate catastrophe, mass migrations and growing economic inequality. Art may seem a luxury as people of color are gunned down by police in American streets. This year\u2019s Biennale, though, explodes these myths.\nOkwui Enwezor of Nigeria is the Venice Biennale\u2019s first African-born curator. Enwezor has been widely credited for bringing political art back to the 120-year-old festival. He says he was partly inspired by the 1974 Biennale, when part of the exhibits were dedicated to Chile, to protest the U.S.-backed coup of Gen. Augusto Pinochet that overthrew Chile\u2019s democratic government. Exhibits that Enwezor has brought to this Biennale include an epic live reading of Karl Marx\u2019s \u201cDas Kapital,\u201d the Brazilian artist Vik Muniz\u2019s piece, a boat covered in the front page of a Venice newspaper published the day after nearly 400 migrants drowned off the Italian island of Lampedusa in October 2013, and Iceland\u2019s controversial pavilion, where an actual mosque was created in a church that had been empty for more than 40 years. The city of Venice shut down the mosque, citing security concerns.\n\u201cToday\u2019s artists are doing much more than providing a mirror,\u201d Anne Pasternak of the organization Creative Time told us at one of the Biennale\u2019s main venues, the Arsenale. \u201cThey\u2019re getting into the gritty work of actual social change.\u201d Creative Time, a New York-based nonprofit that commissions and supports public art and engagement, convened a three-day summit at this year\u2019s Biennale. Hundreds of artists, activists, scholars and others gathered in the 16th-century Teatro alle Tese, part of Venice\u2019s Arsenale. The Arsenale is a vast, ancient walled complex where Venetians built the warships that powered their military dominance in the Mediterranean Sea for centuries. As far back as the 1500s, they could build a warship in one day in what is said to have been the world\u2019s first industrial assembly line.\nNow, the complex is given over to art, theater, music and public discussion, turning swords into plowshares. Among those presenting at the summit was Mariam Ghani, an Afghan-American artist based in Brooklyn, N.Y., who conducted from the stage a video-streamed conversation with her father, Ashraf Ghani, the president of Afghanistan. Through her art, she delves into the dark corners of U.S. foreign and domestic policy. Her collaboration \u201cIndex of the Disappeared\u201d is a physical archive of post-9/11 disappearances, including detentions, deportations and renditions.\nThe Creative Time Summit took place as mass protests marked the first anniversary of the police killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson. The Black Lives Matter movement was central to the summit\u2019s presentations, and was present in the broader Venice Biennale. \u201cAt the moment that we\u2019re dealing with Black Lives Matter and the violence against black people and brown people in the United States, Europe is a experiencing incredible deaths of black people here, too,\u201d said author Sharifa Rhodes-Pitts, referring to the drowning deaths of hundreds of African migrants seeking asylum in Europe. After Venice, Rhodes-Pitts will head to Lampedusa.\nVenice served for centuries as the crossroads of the world, a city where East met West and art flourished. This year\u2019s Venice Biennale, called \u201cAll the World\u2019s Futures,\u201d showcases a growing community of politically engaged artists, who not only reflect the beauty and brutality of the world, but might actually change it."

OOIDA is the nation's largest trade organization of",
        "output": "professional truckers, representing the interests of the country's 350,000 small business truckers.\nDelivering a keynote address to the International Truck and Bus Safety Symposium at the University of Tennessee, Johnston said, \"There is a price to pay for this philosophy of blindly pushing ahead with continuously increasing enforcement. Obviously the millions of dollars invested every year in this effort is a stiff price but even more significant is the rule of diminishing returns.\" Diminishing returns, according to Johnston, result from the negative impact the increasing levels of enforcement are having on professional drivers, influencing many of the best to exit the business.\nJohnston said, \"The exodus of thousands of good, hardworking professional drivers who are sick and tired of being treated as second class citizens or targeted for enforcement in every jurisdiction they pass through, is a substantial loss to the industry and to the effort to improve commercial vehicle safety.\"\nHe pointed out that there is no pool of well-trained replacements to fill the seats of those experienced professionals leaving the industry. New, inexperienced replacements would only have a negative impact on highway safety.\n\"Truckers have far more at stake than most in improved highway safety, and should be considered partners in the efforts instead of the unjustified targets of enforcement efforts.\"\nIn his remarks, Johnston singled out for particular criticism agencies, politicians and other state and federal forums that continually depict truckers as careless, reckless, irresponsible lawbreakers in need of targeted enforcement. He cited several recent examples of law enforcement officials and politicians whose derogatory comments towards truckers were seemingly done for public relations motives, to seek additional funding or simply to cover their \"political behind\".\nJohnston quoted DOT statistics involving fatal collisions between trucks and passenger vehicles showing passenger vehicles were at fault in the vast majority of cases. \"Truckers are the safest drivers on the road and they do an outstanding job in furthering the cause of highway safety\".\nJohnston recommended alternative considerations for budget allocation in addressing highway safety. Commenting on roadside inspections and enforcement for vehicle defects, including the millions of dollars budgeted by states for such new technology as infrared devices which can detect brake problems as trucks go by, Johnston said efforts should be made to direct funding to research for correcting major vehicle defect problems. \"Would it not make more sense to invest some of these resources to develop efficient, dependable brake systems that are less prone to maintenance problems? Does anybody really believe that a large percentage of truckers are knowingly and intentionally running around out there with dangerously defective brakes?\"\nAdditionally, said Johnston, the lack of mandatory standardized training has left the door open for many abuses and a continuing influx of new and unprepared drivers. \"It is absolutely ludicrous that occupations such as barbers, hairdressers and insurance agents are required to go through mandatory training in order to be licensed, but that no training at all is required to obtain a license to operate an 80,000-pound truck over the highway.\"\nJohnston went on to also mention loading and unloading abuses faced by truckers at docks and the lack of adequate parking and rest facilities as other factors impacting on the stress and daily performance of truckers. These are growing problems that must be addressed.\n\"The answer lies not in further victimizing and alienating this force of drivers but rather in finding ways to involve them in addressing the problem,\" Johnston said. \"Truckers are intelligent, patriotic citizens who are willing to work hard and commit their efforts and loyalty when the cause is worthwhile.\""

In order to graduate skilled doctors \u2014 and enough of them \u2014 med schools must invest more in their students\u2019 mental and physical health.\nIt\u2019s no secret medical school is challenging. It should be, of course. Students are learning to navigate matters of life and death. Classes and lab work demand long hours and significant intellectual effort. Students invest years of their time and significant sums of money.\nGiven these challenges, it stands to reason that med schools should do all they can to help their charges succeed.\nAt some schools, however, the academic culture is toxic. Students are expected to master material on their own; seeking help is seen as a sign of weakness. Nearly half of all medical students report having been publicly embarrassed by faculty, staff, or peers.\nOne survey found that about half of medical students are suffering burnout \u2014 that is, severe emotional and physical exhaustion.\nMany talented young people have taken note of these negatives and decided that medicine may not be the right field for them. The number of med school applicants has been flat for the past four years.\nNeither medical schools, nor a healthcare system desperate for doctors, can afford to see the pool of potential med students dry up.\nMedical schools can create a more supportive learning environment without sacrificing rigor.\nSome have heeded that call. The University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine offers free mental health care delivered by a dedicated team of providers to its more than 900 students.\nStanford Medical School runs a cognitive behavioral therapy program to teach techniques for reducing stress.

We\u2019ll need a lot more of them to address our doctor shortage.\nA healthier med school culture may also help diversify the ranks of physicians in the United States. The cutthroat status quo has yielded a doctor workforce that\u2019s almost three-quarters white. Less than 5 percent are black.\nMedical school should be tough. But it doesn\u2019t have to be miserable.

Toddlers can run around in the soft climb and slide zone and larger kids (or adults) can build Lego cars and race against others on a massive inclined racetrack.\nWhen you leave Legoland, you pass through the obligatory gift shop, which sells some fairly hard to find Lego items, so prepare to deal with begging kids and parting with more of your money.\nAdmission to the Chicago Legoland Discovery Center is $19 for adults and $15.00 for kids. Children 2 and under are free. I found the admission price to be fairly high; a family with 2 kids will cost $68 to get in, and you\u2019ll have a hard time keeping the kids entertained for more than 2 or 3 hours. The Legoland Discovery Center is open 7 days a week from 10am till 8pm, but ticket sales end at 6pm.\nLines to get into the Legoland Discovery Center are often wrapped around the building. so I strongly advise purchasing your tickets in advance, as you\u2019ll then be able to skip the long line for the ticket desk. If you arrive with pre-purchased tickets, you can enter through the right hand set of doors. This online advance purchase service also sells off-peak tickets, if you arrive past 3:30pm, you\u2019ll save $2.50 on each ticket.\nAll in all I found the Legoland Discovery Center quite enjoyable, as did my 2 year old daughter. The entrance fee is steep, but unless you plan to fly to California, this is the closest you\u2019ll get to Legoland in the Midwest."

        "output": "by the group, with dire results for civilians,\" Airwars said in a new report summarising its investigations for the year, which it called the \"deadliest yet\" for Iraqis and Syrians.\nThe terrorist group Islamic State drew Western nations into a new Middle Eastern conflict after it captured large swathes of Iraq and Syria in 2014.\nAirwars, which investigates civilian casualty allegations using social media and other information, said that between 3923 and 6102 noncombatants were \"likely killed\" in air and artillery strikes by the United States and its partners in 2017.\nWhile the Airwars data includes strikes by the United States and partner nations including Britain, Australia and France, most of the military activity has been conducted by American forces.\nThe group's estimate is vastly higher than the figure put forward by US Central Command, which conducts its own investigations of selected US strikes.\nAustralia announced in December it had ended its contribution to the air strikes in Iraq and Syria, recalling six super hornet strike aircraft. It continues operations with support aircraft and the Army's training mission.\nThe alleged increase in civilian deaths took place as the United States and partner forces conducted major operations to recapture the city of Mosul, the militants' most important stronghold in Iraq, and Raqqa, the Syrian city where they launched their drive to establish an Islamic caliphate.\nIslamic State militants frequently positioned themselves among civilians and prevented residents from moving around areas they controlled. Both the Australian Defence Force and US military officials have acknowledged the challenge of avoiding unintended deaths in large-scale operations in tightly packed urban areas.\n\"The Australian Defence Force is acutely aware of the brutal tactics used by Daesh and we do our utmost to ensure civilians are clear of targeted locations before and during air strikes,\" a spokesperson told Fairfax Media.\n\"All ADF personnel operate under strict rules of engagement designed to protect our forces, minimise the risk of injury to civilians and strictly comply with Australia's obligations under domestic and international law.\"\nThe coalition does \"everything within its power to limit harm to noncombatants and civilian infrastructure,\" Pentagon spokesperson Eric Pahon added. \"We regularly issue strike reports and civilian casualty reports, including results of credible and non-credible allegations, as well as those still pending assessment, on our public-facing website for the world to see.\"\nThe ADF also publishes monthly reports that track the number of missions and munitions. These reports are regularly aggregated with data from participating coalition nations.\nThe Pentagon has pushed back against a perception in early 2017, when observer groups reported an apparent surge in civilian casualties, that it had altered rules guiding the US air campaign."

Laughing.\nSomewhere next May, after a million rallies in 2015, Murray might win a match he shouldn't only because of the miles he's collected in his tank, only because he vomited in December.\nWelcome to sacrifice, which is when famous folk embrace austerity.

No Internet. \"Whenever we got bored, all we would do is go to the gym.\"\nWelcome to being better which is an ache, a compulsion, a neurosis. Yesterday I asked shooter Jasmine Ser if she had ever practised on Christmas Day. \"Yes,\" she said. \"And on my birthday.

Subtle changes are work. Small alterations in trigger pressure. Tiny modifications of a follow through. Intensity is meeting invention.\nThey test diets. They examine themselves in labs. They experiment with new equipment. Some of them will err. Over-practise. Over-tinker. Overthink. Overdo the weights. Everything is a fine, delicate line. They're driven by ambition yet also by insecurity: they slave partly because, somewhere else, so is someone else. There's nothing quite like the fear of being left behind.\nWelcome to loneliness. The off-season comes with no applause, only satisfaction. Interrupted only by the clunk of weights, improvement is built in silence. There is no single magic workout, no single perfect golf swing.

Discovery of himself while investigating a game. Maybe he will find something.

        "output": "to counter China's \"one country, two systems\" framework for political unification with the island.\nSpokesman for the Chinese Cabinet\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office An Fengshan accused Tsai of harming relations between the sides and using the welfare of the Taiwanese people as a \u201cpoker chip\u201d for the sake of electoral gains.\nSuch actions \"stand in opposition to the interests and welfare of our Taiwan compatriots, and endeavor to block progress by compatriots on both sides to progress,\" An said. \"All it is, is stretching out an arm to block a car,\" he said, using a common Chinese expression to describe a futile action.\nTsai of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party was elected in a 2016 landslide, but has seen her approval ratings fall as she prepares to seek re-election next year.\nIn a meeting on national security Monday, Tsai said relations with China must be \"viewed in a positive way, but only when the principle of equal dignity is safeguarded,\" according to the official Central News Agency.\nTaiwan's legal and political institutions need strengthening and its military needs bolstering \u2014 including through bigger budgets \u2014 while economic competitiveness needs to be raised and greater outreach make to the international community to counter Beijing's isolation campaign, she said.\n\"As long as we stay united, national sovereignty, freedom and democracy will not be eroded, and 'one country, two systems' will not become the future of Taiwan,\" Tsai said.\nChina cut off contacts with Tsai\u2019s government shortly after her election and has deployed a carrot-and-stick strategy to undercut her support among the island\u2019s voters. That includes inducements for Taiwanese to live and work in China by offering them local legal status, appealing especially to young creatives and technology workers frustrated by Taiwan\u2019s small market and stagnant wages.\nIt has backed that up with a drive to poach away Taiwan's dwindling number of diplomatic allies, leaving it with just 17, blocking its participation in international gatherings and stepping-up its saber rattling through wargames and threatening statements from leading military figures.\nThose include president and ruling Communist Party Xi Jinping, who commands the armed forces, and in a January address renewed the threat of military action against the island. He received further endorsement from members of the Beijing-appointed Taiwan delegation to this month\u2019s annual meeting of China\u2019s ceremonial legislature, none of whom come from Taiwan or have any more than tenuous connections to the island.\nXi \"will not allow (unification) to be postponed indefinitely,\" Hong Kong's South China Morning Post newspaper quoted delegate Cai Peihui as saying.\nChina\u2019s strategy and impatience with Tsai\u2019s administration among Taiwanese voters seems to be having an effect. The DPP took a beating in November\u2019s local elections, and public opinion surveys put her approval rating at around 25 percent.\nWhile Taiwanese increasingly favor closer economic ties and exchanges with Taiwan, the island's 23 million residents as a whole remain overwhelmingly opposed to political unification with China.\nAlthough the U.S. cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan in favor of China 40 years ago, it remains a strong Taiwanese ally and is legally committed to consider threats to the island a matter of deep concern.\nSupport for Taiwan has remained strong under President Donald Trump and the island\u2019s request for new warplanes and other armaments have been seen as receiving a friendly reception in Washington, which is at loggerheads with Beijing over trade and other issues."

In either case, the effect is to dilute the impact of a particular group of voters.\nFor packing, see Northeastern Pennsylvania. A large majority of Democratic voters are concentrated in the 17th Congressional District, a convoluted, meandering district that picks off most urban areas in the region. That, in turn, guarantees substantial Republican majorities in the neighboring 10th and 11th Districts.\nGerrymandering is a major factor in today\u2019s poisonous politics and paralyzed governance.\nIn this session, the state Legislature should adopt a state constitutional amendment to create a nonpartisan redistricting commission so that it will be in place to handle the job after the 2020 census."

After making $575,000 at Georgia this season, Bobo\u2019s five-year deal with CSU will",
        "output": "include annual raises, and his base salary will average slightly more than $1.5 million.\nBobo will succeed Jim McElwain, who accepted the job at Florida after guiding the Rams to a 10-2 regular-season record in his third season at CSU.\nWith CSU president Tony Frank involved, final interviews of candidates were conducted Sunday in Las Vegas, the day after the Rams fell 45-10 to Utah in the Las Vegas Bowl.\nThe hiring of Bobo, at least on the surface, is going back to a repeat formula \u2014 tapping a Southeastern Conference offensive coordinator \u2014 as CSU attempts to build on the Rams\u2019 surprising season and move toward finalization of plans for construction of an on-campus stadium to open in 2017.\nMcElwain was 49 and well-traveled as an assistant, and had spent four seasons as offensive coordinator at Alabama when he took the CSU job in late 2011 with a starting base salary of $1.35 million. His base salary this season, in the first year of a new five-year deal he signed in June, was $1.5 million.\nAfter the Sunday interviews in Las Vegas, CSU closed in on an agreement with Bobo on Monday morning. A deal was closed late in the afternoon, subject to the attorneys\u2019 final scrutiny, and shortly before 9 p.m., the school announced the hire and the Tuesday news conference.\nBobo was the Georgia\u2019s prep player of the year in 1993 at Thomasville High School, near the Georgia-Florida border. He played for his father, George, who was a longtime successful high school coach.\nAs a Georgia quarterback from 1994-97, Bobo played three seasons with former Broncos cornerback Champ Bailey, and he was a freshman when Terrell Davis was a senior. Bobo ranks third on the Bulldogs\u2019 career passing list, with 6,334 yards.\nBobo has spent all but one season of his coaching career at his alma mater. He was a graduate assistant for two years and was on the Jacksonville State staff for the 2000 season before returning to Georgia as quarterbacks coach under Mark Richt. Bobo was promoted to offensive coordinator in 2007, with Richt relinquishing the play-calling duties. Bobo worked with, among others, quarterbacks David Greene, Aaron Murray of the Kansas City Chiefs and Matthew Stafford of the Detroit Lions.\nRicht often has been under fire despite an excellent overall record. So it\u2019s not surprising that Bobo also has drawn barbed criticism at times from a wing of Georgia fandom, but that has quieted in recent seasons as the transition to a no-huddle, spread approach led to sometimes stunning production.\nThe Bulldogs, with Murray at quarterback, set school records for points and touchdowns in 2012 and averaged 36.7 points in 2013. This season, the Bulldogs (9-3) are eighth in the nation in scoring, averaging 41.7 points, 13th in rushing (255 yards) and 88th in passing (200 yards), with senior Hutson Mason completing 67.9 percent of his passes 2,019 yards and 15 touchdowns, with only four interceptions.\nGeorgia faces Louisville in the Belk Bowl on Dec. 30.\nAt CSU, offensive coordinator Dave Baldwin, who oversaw a Rams attack that averaged nearly 500 yards per game in the regular season, was interim head coach after McElwain\u2019s departure.\nAlthough Oregon offensive coordinator Scott Frost was contacted about the job and since November had been mentioned as a possible candidate to succeed McElwain if he left, it has been clear for weeks that Frost was unlikely to be sold on coming to CSU.\nThe CSU coaching search had been ongoing since McElwain\u2019s departure, and involved the Chicago-based search firm DHR International as consultants. Executive vice presidents Glenn Sugiyama and Pat Richter, a former NFL receiver and athletic director at Wisconsin, were the original DHR representatives as the firm and CSU worked to screen and vet candidates through initial interviews \u2014 including one with Bobo.\nOthers in the mix during the process included Baldwin; Ohio State co-defensive coordinator Chris Ash; former Southern California associate coach John Baxter; Michigan State defensive coordinator Pat Narduzzi; Texas defensive coordinator Vance Bedford, a one-time CSU assistant under Earle Bruce; and former CSU players Billy Gonzales, co-offensive coordinator at Mississippi State; and Tony Alford, running backs coach at Notre Dame.\nMcElwain\u2019s latest contract included annual one-year rollovers that could be triggered by either side, and it called for CSU to get a $7.5 million buyout \u2014 officially in \u201cliquidated damages\u201d \u2014 if he left. That figure was tied to the value left on his deal, so the figure could go up if he met \u201cachievement\u201d clauses that increased his base salary. CSU eventually agreed to accept $5 million and a $2 million guarantee for a road game at Florida.\nAfter McElwain took the Florida job, CSU interim athletic director John Morris indicated a buyout would be part of the next coach\u2019s deal as well, but he didn\u2019t discuss a specific figure. It\u2019s expected that Bobo\u2019s buyout will be more in line with industry norms \u2014 significant and designed to compensate the school left behind, but not so daunting that it potentially could lock in a coach at a school against his wishes at some point.\n\u2022 Has been offensive coordinator at Georgia since 2007.\n\u2022 Has coached several prominent quarterbacks at Georgia, including No. 1 overall draft pick Matthew Stafford.\n\u2022 As Georgia quarterback, set school record for completion percentage in a season (.650).\n\u2022 Star player at Thomasville High School; named 1993 Georgia player of the year by USA Today.\n\u2022 Married to the former Lainie Meshad.

        "output": "rifle before SDNY Judge Paul G. Gardephe. But on March 22 the courtroom was quiet with six in the audience and the defense lawyers - but not prosecutors - waiting. Inner City Press stopped in and waited, since neither the government nor administration will commit to announcing when the jury comes back. The public has spent much money on this prosecution; the government called it a proceeding of interest. But where are the exhibits? Where is the commitment to notice? What of general deterrence, if it comes to that? Back on March 20 the lawyer asked, Do you think you could stuff this rifle in your pants? And get in the back of a taxi? It's ludicrous. He also mocked a proffered jailhouse confession -- \"who does that?\" -- and emphasized that government witness Rosario had access to discovery in the case. You've read the book, now you can tell the story, the defense lawyer snarked, telling you jury, You won't lend these witnesses fifty dollars, why should you believe them? The rifle appeared again, (mis) described as a \"baby AK\" in connection with the \"chicken spot shooting.\" At day's end on March 18, the defense had asked for a ruling on a cryptic note among the 3500 material: \"Prince shot Box kills = beef b/t egp and brims.\" Judge Gardephe asked the lawyers, That's some gangster or gang? Well, yes: East Gangster Bloods and bloodhound brims, was the answer, all leading to a shoot out on White Plains Road in The Bronx. Judge Gardephe said, Let the jury decide what it means, if as the government says it's two incidents (Prince being shot and Box being killed) or at the defense surmises, Prince shooting Box to death. Judge Gardephe said he will rule on March 19 on the phone calls Latique Johnson the defendant wants to offer. The case began with a sealed indictment, signed by Preet Bharara in 2016, alleging the use of a firearm for a drug dealing conspiracy in The Bronx. Preet has moved on, but the trial continues. On March 15 there was talk of sour diesel marijuana packed in vacuum sealed bags, BWM car keys and digital scales. Judge Gardephe said he would not be comfortable with a witness saying he thought the Facebook photo showed marijuana; the relative attributability of Instagram and Facebook pages was discussed, although the companies are commonly owned. During the trial the jury has only sat 9:30 to 2:30; next week it will shift to a full shift to 5 pm if Judge Gardephe has his way. Inner City Press will be there - watch this site. Back on March 8 a shooting in The Bronx in October 2018 was the subject of an ill-attended SDNY conference. Jerome Jackson is described as in a white t-shirt with silver handgun on 2 October 2018 on Freeman Street - but in the SDNY courtroom of Judge Kevin Castel he was in jail house blues and shackles. His lawyer Julia Gatto questioned whether the NYPD detectives who questioned Jackson about the shooting were in fact part of a joint task force with the Feds - no, Karin Potlock for the government said, and on that basis no suppression - and questioned probable cause. There will be a hearing on that on April Fools Day and Inner City Press aims to be there. The case is US v. Jackson, 18 CR 760. A week before on March 1 when Statue of Liberty climber Patricia Okoumou appeared in the SDNY , it was to face revocation of bail for more recent climbs, all to protest the separation of immigrant families. SDNY Judge Gorenstein did not revoke bail but imposed house arrest. He jibed that it appeared Ms. Okoumou could only support herself by donations garnered by climbing. Afterward Inner City Press asked her lawyer Ron Kuby about this argument. He said the judge has it precisely wrong, or in reverse: she raised money because she is an activist, she is not an actively in order to make money. Ms. Okoumou raised her fist, and headed to Staten Island. Photos here. Inner City Press, which interviewed Okoumou on December 5 just after another SDNY decision, in the Patrick Ho / CEFC China Energy UN bribery case, headed out and streamed this Periscope, and this Q&A, with more to come, on this case and others. How guns eject shell casings was the subject of expert testimony in a Bronx gang trial on February 27 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Before Judge Robert W. Sweet, an ATF agent traced a bullet back to Illinois; under cross examination he said a shell casing might eject feet rather than yards unless it bounced on something. Then testimony went back to 2007, a 14-year old with a gun heading from the Millbrook projects to the Mitchell Houses. The defense asked for a mistrial when the name of a second gang was introduced; the prosecution shot back (so to speak) that it came from photos on the defendant's own Facebook page. And so it goes in trials these days. Back on February 25 a prison sentence of life plus five years was imposed for a Bronx murder by SDNY Chief Judge Colleen McMahon on February 25. She presided over the trial in which Stiven Siri-Reynoso was convicted of, among other things, murder in aid of racketeering for the death of Jessica White, a 28 year old mother of three, in the Bronx in 2016. Jessica White's mother was in the court room; she was greeted by Judge McMahon but declined to speak before sentencing. Siri-Reynoso was representing himself by this point, with a back-up counsel by his side. Judge McMahon told him, \"You're a very smart man... a tough guy, a calculating person... You are a coward, sent a child to do it for you... Your emissary shot the wrong person, a lovely lady... It was a vicious, evil attack against the good people of that neighborhood.\" When she imposed the life plus five sentence, a woman on the Jessica White side of the courtroom cried out, yes Ma'am, put the animal away! Later, after Siri-Reynoso ended asking how he can get more documents about the case, a woman on his side of the courtroom said, \"No te preocupes, muchacho, Dios sabe lo que hace\" - don't worry, God knows what he is doing. But does He? Earlier on February 25 when the government tried to defend its 2018 change of policy or practice on Special Immigrant Juvenile status in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York Judge John G. Koeltl had many questions about the change. He asked, are you saying that all the decisions before 2018 were just wrong, under a policy in place but not implemented at the time? In the overflow courtroom 15C the largely young audience laughed, as the government lawyer tried to say it wasn't a change of policy but rather an agency interpretation of the statute. Shouldn't there have been notice and comment rulemaking under the Administrative Procedure Act? The government said the argument proffered for this was about the Freedom of Information Act (on which, as Inner City Press has noted, the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has similarly reversed its policy 180 degrees without justification). SDNY Judge Koeltl demanded t know if the government is arguing that no juvenile court in New York, California (and maybe Texas for other reasons he said) is empowered to grant relief. The answer was far from clear - but where the ruling is going does seem so. Watch this site. The Bangladeshi Central Bank which was hacked for $81 million in February 2016, on January 31 sued in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. Now the first pre-trial conference in the case has been set, for 2 April 2019 before SDNY Judge Lorna G. Schofield. Inner City Press will be there."

It was a vedict for democracy in a democratic nation,\" Nasreen told IPS.\nThe swanky rented apartment in the city's upmarket Rawdon Street, complete with avant-garde paintings and ethnic furniture, is a far cry from the cheap hotel rooms that she favoured some years back and bears testimony to the relative stability that seems to have come into this exiled Bangladeshi writer's tumultuous life.\nSecurity checks at the gate and the policeman posted outside her apartment are reminders that she continues to be on the hit-list of Islamic fundamentalists both in West Bengal and in her native Bangladesh.\nIt is another matter that the third volume of her autobiography was controversial, more for the hints at her alleged sexual liaisons with the cream of literary intelligentsia in West Bengal and in Bangladesh, than for anything else.\n\"If the ruling communists proscribed the book to appease some fundamentalists, then they were not real friends of Muslims,\" Nasreen, a gynecologist who styles herself as a feminist, said bluntly.\nShe could not have been unaware that her statements could anger the communists in West Bengal, on whose support the Congress-party-led coalition government in New Delhi depends, and affect the status of her one-year entry visa. But then Nasreen has seldom cared for the consequences of her often reckless actions.\nNasreen, who is now penning the fifth volume of her seven-part autobiography, titled \"Ami Bhalo Achi, Tum Bhalo Theko, Priyo Desh\" (I am fine, take care, my beloved country), on her life in exile in Europe between 1994 and 1997, said the Leftists were pandering to a handful of fundamentalists just to garner votes.\nShe first went into hiding in 1994 and then fled Bangladesh with support from international human rights organizations like PEN and Amnesty International and was given asylum in Sweden. Since then she has lived in Germany, France, the United States and India.\nIn her third volume, Nasreen had, using her talent at mixing issues, managed to bracket \"progressive\" Bengali intelligentsia with religious fundamentalists.\n''I have read the book many times, goaded 25 eminent persons to read it and then we took the decision after considering every opinion,'' West Bengal Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya had said while imposing the ban.\nBy quashing the ban, the Calcutta High Court undermined the communist government's contention that the book's harsh take on how women under Islam was offensive to Muslims and could cause unrest in the state, which borders Islamic Bangladesh.\n\"Women are worst victims of Islam,\" reiterated Nasreen, who has been sued by an Indian poet, Syed Hasmat Jalal, for making the hints at sexual liaisons between her and Bengali literary figures in her controversial volume.\n\"My memoir's purpose was not to prove that I am a good person, a saint, a goddess. My purpose was to describe the beautiful, the not-so-beautiful and the in-between events that happen in one's literary life,'' said Nasreen.\nThe 395-page volume was also banned in Bangladesh, where it was published under the title \"Ka\", (or Speak) after Islamic fundamentalists objected to it.\nTaslima Nasreen fled her native country in 1994 after her book, \"Lajja\",(or Shame), dealing with the plight of Hindus in Bangladesh, angered Muslim hardliners who threatened to kill her."

        "output": "women comprise 45.9 per cent of all employees in Australia, according to the Workplace Gender Equality Agency, they account for less less than 20 per cent of the Australian ICT workforce. The lack of female representation at senior levels is even greater, according to professional services firm Deloitte.\nReason to celebrate... companies are reporting good results from their gender diversity policies.\nSome companies want to redress the imbalance. For example, Westpac has set an aspirational target of 50 per cent female representation within leadership roles by 2017.\nHere IT Pro continues the conversation about legislated female quotas and the need to attract more schoolgirls into technology careers with a look at gender diversity policies that are working for companies employing women both in technology and other leadership roles and with tips on how to avoid it all going pear shaped.\nIf you want to see more talented women in technology and leadership roles, it\u2019s essential that senior male leaders champion change, says Dayle Stevens, NAB head of enterprise application and data services, technology.\n\"As the majority of senior roles in technology are held by men, the sponsorship and support of senior leaders is key.\"\nRole models are also important, says Stevens. \"Examples set by senior leaders can inspire positive change and help [women] see that maintaining [work/life] balance is possible.\"\nJust make sure middle management is also aligned with the same values, says Ros Harvey, founding director of Sense-T at the University of Tasmania, and a veteran of corporate responsibility and labour standards for agencies of the World Bank.\nWhere you recruit from is important, says Harvey. \"Don't just recruit through technical trade channels as they are mainly male dominated. Recruit wider and go through channels that reach women.\"\nNAB, Westpac, and global software consulting company ThoughtWorks aim to hire equal numbers of men and women in their graduate programs.\nLindy Stephens, director of social impact at ThoughtWorks, says companies need to set recruitment targets because \"good intentions don't work\".\n\"The minute we had quotas for recruiters, the situation changed overnight. Having quotas doesn't mean we hire women without merit. Women with merit are out there, but we have to find them.\"\nThe percentage of women employed in ThoughtWorks Australia increased from 19 per cent to 40 percent since 2011. Similarly, NAB aims at hiring equal numbers of men and women in its graduate programs. As of September 2013, 47 per cent of the graduates who accepted positions in the bank's 2014 graduate program were women.\nIn 2010, the bank also set a target to raise the proportion of women on its Group subsidiary board from 14 per cent to 38 percent by the end of 2013, at September women accounted for 30 per cent of executive management.\nWhile some organisations find formal targets help get more women into the business, and then into leadership positions, others see it as an undeserving advantage.\nOne man who runs a public relations company says he is angry that there should be \"a special elevator to the top jobs just for people in skirts\". The man who asked to remain anonymous, says women should be promoted on merit, just like men.\nGoogle doesn\u2019t have formal targets. \"It's more about how to build a healthy team,\" says Mary Selby, engineering manager at Google in Sydney. \"We encourage women in other ways.\"\nBut why not have targets, or even legislated quotas, if decades of other methods haven't worked, asks Harvey.\n\"It's the definition of insanity \u2013 to keep doing the same thing and expect different results. Quotas work and they set a hard metric. We already have quotas in Parliament. We can extend these concepts to gender.\"\nShe says quotas are dangerous when no effort is made to find talented women and a role is handed to someone who is not qualified.\nPrograms where women can develop their knowledge and skills in the workplace, and address any weaknesses when competing in a male environment is proving a good policy for Google and others.\n\"The key is building confidence in women,\" says Selby.\nCisco has a future leaders program where high potential women are groomed to take on senior roles. Two recent participants have been promoted to sales directors.\nThoughtWorks has a Women In Leadership Development program, which helps women set high goals and visions, and discusses what could be holding them back, such as lack of confidence, or experience in negotiating salaries.\nBut it's pointless having gender policies if relationships aren't strong enough within a team, says Martine Harkin, facilitator at Leading Teams, which runs leadership development and training courses.\n\"Men have to be involved in the conversation. It's not just women who have to do something about [gender imbalance]. You have the best results when the whole team is engaged, and you can all discuss the consequences of not having women leaders.\"\nMany organisations, such as ThoughtWorks, match mentors with people on similar career paths for advice and guidance. \"It's important to pick the right mentor,\" says Harkin.\nCisco has a shadowing program. \"If a woman wants to be the next CIO then she will follow the CIO around,\" says head of human resources Danielle Weese.\nCisco allows flexible working hours and employees can work from home if needed. Both men and women can schedule their hours around, say, dropping off the kids at school, says Weese, who recently spent three months working in Canada while looking after her sick mother.\nParental leave at full pay - ThoughtWorks offers 18 weeks for the primary carer and two weeks for the secondary - part-time and job-sharing roles are also policies that are begining to make a difference, even if the company has had to work hard to convince some clients their consultants do not need to work full-time."

Runs on AA battery (not included). No passive mode for listening.\nIf you want to effectively block outside noise, but bulky headphones aren't your thing, Sony's MDR-NC300D is a solid in-ear noise-cancellation solution. But you'll have to sacrifice some audio quality in the bargain.\nSony has included embedded noise-cancellation in some of its Walkman portable media players, like the X Series ($299.00, ), for a while now. The company moves the circuitry out of the player and into the earphones with its ($299.99 direct) MDR-NC300D. The in-ear 'phones actively block out sound, and even analyze your environment to determine which of its three selectable noise cancellation modes is the best choice. The NC300D does a solid job dampening the outside din, but drawbacks include subpar audio performance and a bulky on-cable circuitry-and-battery compartment.\nThe earpieces on the MDR-NC300D look a bit large, but aren't heavy and stay in place just fine. Microphones, pointing outward on each earpiece in order to sample the ambient room noise and feed it to the noise canceling circuitry, are the primary reason for the bulkiness of the black-and-chrome design. The largish 2.9-by-1.3-by-0.7-inch circuitry-and-battery compartment sits about halfway of the way down the 47.2-inch cable. With the required single AA battery installed, the MDR-NC300D weighs 2.2 ounces\u0097it doesn't operate in a passive mode without the battery like the Creative Aurvana X-Fi ($300.00, ), for example, does. Five sizes of rubber ear-tips come with the earphones, as does a velvet pouch, a leather carrying case, an earphone extension cable, an airline adapter, and a shirt clip. Sony estimates battery life at about 15 hours, but, of course, this depends on what brand you use, and the AA battery is not included.\nUsing the included shirt clip, which attaches to the back of the circuitry/battery compartment is pretty much essential\u0097otherwise, you'll have this heavy, awkward box dangling from the cable\u0097and likely yanking the earpieces from your ears. A Monitor button on the front face of the compartment mutes all music and disengages the noise canceling circuitry\u0097but still utilizes the microphones\u0097so you can hear what's going on in the outside world with a simple push. Beside the button is a tiny battery-life-indicator and mode display. The Sound Mode button is on the top panel, along with the Volume rocker, and the Power/Hold switch.\nSony is proud of its new technology, claiming it's the only manufacturer to offer true 100 percent digital noise cancellation. And the MDR-NC300D impresses with its array of noise-cancellation modes. Mode A focuses on low-to mid-range frequencies (best for airplanes), Mode B focuses on extremely low frequencies (better for trains and buses), and Mode C minimizes over a wide band of frequencies (ideal for noisy office settings). In addition, you can press the \"NC Optimize\" button on the back panel of the compartment, which, according to Sony, adjusts the noise canceling signal shape to fit the unique contour of your inner ear. Adjusting this setting, which spans from -10 up to 10, seems to allow more low frequencies through at the lowest setting and higher frequencies at the highest setting. During testing, I kept my NC Optimization set to 0.\nGiven their respective sizes, it's not quite fair to compare the noise cancellation of the MDR-NC300D with headphones trying to accomplish the same task. Bose's $299 QuietComfort 15 ($299.95, ) headphones are the best noise canceling pair available, but Sony's earphones use their in-ear seal to great advantage. Combining passive reduction with the active digital noise-canceling circuitry\u0097and the ability to adjust which frequencies get the most attention\u0097the MDR-NC300D rivals just about any other model you can buy. Thing is, there aren't many in-ear 'phones with active cancellation on the market. Denon makes an in-ear model, the AH-NC600 ($199.99, ) that sounds fantastic, but its noise cancellation is merely decent\u0097the opposite of the MDR-NC300D. Denon can't touch the selectable modes and the excellent seal created by Sony's comfortable rubbery ear tips.\nUnfortunately, like with Bose's earlier QuietComfort headphone models, audio performance is not a strong suit here. During testing regardless of the sound mode I selected, the audio was a bit too sculpted for my taste. My primary complaint is the earphones are overly crisp\u0097the Rolling Stone's \"Rocks Off\" sounds too sibilant and bright, although Bass mode seemed to balance things out a bit. Basically, the middle frequencies seem a bit under-represented. Movie mode is helpful for hearing dialogue better\u0097especially if you are in a particularly loud environment that the noise cancellation can't completely conquer. The bass response, in Bass mode, is definitely enjoyable, but it's offset a bit by the middle frequency deficiencies.\nIs the sound you'll get from the MDR-NC300D downright awful? Not by any stretch of the imagination. The thing is, though, the audio quality isn't what you'd expect from a $300 pair of earphones. But again, the noise cancellation is top-notch. While it isn't fair to compare apples and oranges, it's worth noting that Bose has made strides in the frequency response of its QuietComfort line\u0097the same-price QC 15 still isn't a sonic masterpiece, but it does offer a better listening experience than the MDR-NC300D. Why don't these pricey products deliver audio bliss? It's simple: All the manufacturing cost is sunk into the impressive noise-canceling technology and the hardware\u0097with little left for the earphone's drivers, which are responsible for sound quality.\nIf you eschew bulky over-the-ear headphones like the Bose QuietComfort 15, but effective noise cancellation is your top priority, the Sony MDR-NC300D is a solid option. But if sound quality trumps dampening the outside din, you should skip this pair and check out the $200 Denon AH-NC600, which offers capable-but-not-astounding noise reduction and great audio performance for $100 less.\nCompare the Sony MDR-NC300D with several other headphones side by side.\nBottom Line: If you want to effectively block outside noise, but bulky headphones aren't your thing, Sony's MDR-NC300D is a solid in-ear noise-cancellation solution. But you'll have to sacrifice some audio quality in the bargain."

What did you understand about the Jallianwala Bagh massacre as a child?\nVN Datta: It was horrible\u2026 Our house was a 10-minute walk from Jallianwala Bagh at Katra Sher Singh in the walled city of Amritsar. My elder sister told me that she heard",
        "output": "the bullets and that my mother began to beat her chest thinking that my father was dead. When I was about six years\u2019 old, I used to walk in the Bagh and observe the bullet marks on the walls. Because of my family memory, I, too, became an indirect witness to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. Later, I wrote extensively on the subject. My book, Jallianwala Bagh, appeared in 1969.\nND:Why do you think Brigadier General Reginald Dyer did what he did?\nVND: You have to think of the circumstances which led to Dyer\u2019s action. After the victory in World War I, British confidence was at its peak. In addition, Punjab was ruled by the iron hand of Lieutenant Governor, Sir Michael O\u2019Dwyer. He terrorised the troops and peasants. And then came the infamous Rowlatt Bills. There was political unrest in the province.\nDyer did not look upon Jallianwala Bagh massacre as an isolated event, but as an integral part of the Amritsar disturbances. Three days before, on the 10th, the city had been the scene of widespread violence following the arrest of local leaders from Punjab\u2014Dr Saifuddin Kitchlew, Dr Satya Pal, Bugga and Ratto; five Europeans had been murdered; and a lady missionary, Miss Sherwood, had been assaulted. I would say that the assault on Miss Sherwood provided the context for Jallianwala Bagh incident to happen.\nAs a result, Dyer became furious and determined. He rushed from Jalandhar on 11 April. On 12 April, he moved around the city of Amritsar. On 13 April, from the Hathi Gate, he reached the narrow Jallianwala Bagh. He could not take the machine guns inside. With 50 troops on the platform\u201425 Gurkhas, 25 Baluchis\u2014he shot about 1,650 bullets, and I calculated around 700 people died. He later told the Disorders Inquiry Committee that he realised his force was small and to hesitate might induce attack.\nI believe Dyer\u2019s decision in Jallianwala Bagh was partly influenced by his seeing Amritsar as a possible storm-centre of rebellion and partly by the circumstances of 10 April.\nThe Punjab Government feared that on the Baisakhi Day a large number of villagers would come to the city and their presence would make the situation sinister. On 12 and 13 April, Dyer issued two orders banning public meetings and processions in Amritsar city. When the massacre took place, martial law had not been introduced and the Brigadier General was not empowered to take charge of the city. But Dyer assumed full control of the situation and ignored the civilian officers. My argument is had he acted in concert with civilian officers, it is possible that the catastrophic episode might have been averted.\nAs soon as Dyer arrived in the Bagh, he stood on the raised platform and opened fire without warning. Not only this but, he fired continuously even when he could see that people were running for their lives. The Hunter Committee accused him of infringing the principle of minimum force, but failed to explain satisfactorily why he did so, maintaining that Dyer merely exceeded the bounds of his duty.\nAll these insights were possible because of my discovery of the volumes VI and VII of the Disorders Inquiry Committee (also known as the Hunter Committee) to which Dyer gave an account of his actions. I noticed that the previous volumes, I\u2013V, did not contain the material that these two volumes possessed. These latter volumes included consolidated reports secretly maintained by the British government. I was the first to bring these volumes to the notice of scholars and able to discover hitherto unknown facts.\nND: It is evident that your pioneering work provides an altogether different historical perspective on 1919. Tell us how you would interpret the Jallianwala Bagh massacre?\nVND: I feel that the massacre was the result of a well-planned conspiracy aimed at bringing together a crowd which could be killed by Dyer. There was no martial law (in Amritsar and Lahore) till 15 April. There were no police present at Jallianwala Bagh. The Deputy Commissioner was absent from the scene. Dyer took no steps to prevent the meeting.\nND: Why do you call the massacre a conspiracy?\nVND: In order to understand the massacre, it is necessary to follow the movements of Hans Raj, the chief organiser of the Jallianwala Bagh meeting. At the time of the meeting, when some people began to move away, he urged the crowd to be seated and declared \u2018the Government will never fire\u2019. After a while, he waved his handkerchief and Dyer and his Indian troops appeared. When the shooting began, Hans Raj had already left. He was an agent provocateur. He was later spirited away to Mesopotamia and his house in Amritsar was burnt.\nND: Who was in the crowd? Who were the prominent leaders present in the Bagh?\nVND: Before the massacre, Jallianwala Bagh was a dumping ground of no political significance. In his testimony to the Disorders Inquiry Committee, Dyer said that the crowd was not innocent but hostile. He claimed it was a planned affair, with an organised mob assembled with the intent of defying authority.\nBut the crowd was an amorphous lot. Many had come to the city as part of a cattle fair on the Baisakhi festival and had wandered into the Bagh. There was no leader of importance present there. I talked to people who had survived the massacre. I interviewed Rattan Devi, Uttar Kaur and Uttam Devi, who rushed to the Bagh immediately after the firing. Their testimonies formed an essential part of my book, Jallianwala Bagh. I also had long conversations with Dr Kitchlew. Despite his failing health, he gave me valuable information. Hans Raj Mittal, a leading lawyer of Amritsar, told me that the Jallianwala Bagh episode was a conspiracy hatched by Hans Raj.\nND: What is the legacy of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre?\nVND: After the massacre\u2014as SK Datta, principal of Forman Christian College, Lahore, said\u2014there was a parting of ways between the British and Indians. The massacre paved the way for the ultimate downfall of the British Empire and a new leadership by Gandhi appeared on the national scene.\nIn my works, I have tried to move away from a nationalist hagiography of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. However, there is no doubt that it proved a great asset to the nationalist cause. 1919 changed the political complexion of Punjab, which could never recover from that military violence.\n\u2014 This interview is one of a series of interviews with VN Datta conducted by Nonica Datta between July 2018 and April 2019 in New Delhi."

I haven\u2019t responded to any of those invitations to sue yet, though I\u2019m intrigued by the prospect of being",
        "output": "compensated by that company for losses caused by their negligence. Like most PG&E customers, I\u2019ve had issues with them for decades, often recognizing that they were gouging rate payers and that we all were held captive by a \u201cpublic\u201d utility that was a private enterprise, based on profit and the need to satisfy shareholders with ever greater return on their investments. Those profits came at the expense of people who often couldn\u2019t afford the rate increases that were always being assessed. Then, too, the lock PG&E had on politicians and the Public Utilities Commission made consumers feel powerless because there was only one source of gas and electric power, at least for most people.\nIn the course of my life, I\u2019ve lived in places where it wasn\u2019t necessary for me to be a customer of PG&E, and I always liked it when I didn\u2019t need to be a client of that monopoly, one I had seen use its power to ensure that it got its way with politicians and those people and entities who were supposed to police how the company conducted itself. For a decade, my electrical needs were met by the Rural Electric Association that served people who lived in the sticks of Plumas County. I liked being served by that outfit and noted the differences between how the REA operated and how PG&E operated. For another six years, we lived in Washington State, in one of the public utility districts in which oversight was more responsibly regulated and monitored. We also lived in Sacramento for a time, and we once again find ourselves living there, now served by the Sacramento Municipal Utilities District (SMUD) which seemed before and seems now like a better thing.\nI used to write editorials critical of PG&E back in the 80s when I was editing the Green Mountain Gazette up in Quincy. PG&E\u2019s record and reputation was already shady, and though the line workers and repair guys and other front-line service personnel were usually damn good, the guys in the suits were looking out for their jobs and their perks, all of which were dependent on keeping the bottom line high, the operating costs low, and the profit margin higher in service to the shareholders who took precedence over customers. I noted, too, a pattern that PG&E exhibited in being neglectful of public safety concerns, then getting bailed out when the company\u2019s negligence or ineptitude or false economies created a big public liability, with taxpayers getting stuck for the damages done or the losses incurred. Either that, or PG&E would threaten bankruptcy, as they are doing now.\nWith all that history of antipathy and even hostility toward PG&E, you\u2019d think I\u2019d be anxious to join one of the suits being filed against them. But lawyers are one category of people I am even more wary of than I am of big corporate exploiters of basic human needs. And though I know that class action suits of this kind usually don\u2019t cost the clients anything until or unless the cases filed are successful in court, I am hesitant about getting caught up in a whole lot of paperwork or time-and-energy consuming efforts that may drag on in the courts for years. And, given the power and influence PG&E has demonstrated in getting out of earlier liabilities for a lengthening trail of earlier screw ups, the whole effort could be for naught.\nBut I surely would love to claim some loot from the people who have charged me excessively for so long for using resources that belong to all of us, the power generated by water that isn\u2019t owned by PG&E. Then, too, PG&E, like the oil companies, is heavily subsidized by taxpayers. And there is no doubt in my mind that the fire that happened on the morning of November 8th could have been avoided with greater care and responsibility on the part of PG&E management who were more concerned about profits than taking care of the business of keen-eyed upkeep, maintenance, and public safety. Any money that might be awarded to fire victims would seem no less than what I and and many others are entitled to for damages that money can\u2019t fix and for suffering that has no price. But I\u2019d take it, not because I am in particular need, but because it seems just to compensate people for injuries inflicted. It seems only right that PG&E should be held responsible and accountable for the harm they\u2019ve done to so many.\nThe problem is these corporate CEOs always have a way of weaseling out of paying for the harm done. Even now, the honchos at PG&E are being awarded huge bonuses, money in the millions for several of the top guns. If being held responsible for screwing up is \u201cwhy they get the big bucks,\u201d that sure wouldn\u2019t seem to apply to these people at the top of that reckless and heartless corporation. Will they pay? Hell no. They\u2019re in line for big rewards for their service, not to customers, but to the investors, damn few of whom lived on the Paradise ridge. And I don\u2019t think any of those execs due to get millions in bonuses have been exposed to much fire or rain in their plush mansions. Especially not fires set ablaze by their indifference to upkeep and public safety."

These GPS-guided missiles will serve as an alternative to the inertial navigation rockets that lose of their accuracy the further they fly.\nThe IDF's working assumption is that these missiles will make their way to Iran's main proxy in the Middle East, Lebanese terror organization Hezbollah, which receives 75 percent of its budget from Tehran.\nThe development of the new RAAD missile is based on a fairly new approach to developing weapons: being able to manufacture advanced weapons independently from Russia.\nAn accurate missile, such as the ones being developed in Iran, is one that has a hit radius of no more than several dozens of meters from its designated target.\nFor the sake of comparison, with the rockets Hezbollah currently has in its arsenal, the terror group would have to fire a barrage of dozens of projectiles towards central Israel to increase the chances of hitting the the Kirya IDF headquarters in Tel Aviv. But only one accurate missile\u2014assuming it is not intercepted\u2014would be needed to achieve the same objective.\nHowever, Western defense officials are not yet convinced Iran has completed development of the new precision-guided missiles.\nMeanwhile, a recent airstrike on the Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Center (CERS), attributed to Israel by Arab media, reportedly laid waste to alleged Iranian infrastructure for the production of advanced arms for Hezbollah.\nCERS manufactures missiles based on scientific knowhow from North Korea and Iran. The Syrian center also develops chemical weapons and other munitions for Hezbollah, such as S-60 missiles.\nAt present, Hezbollah's precision-guided weapons arsenal is minor: A handful of accurate attack drones and \"suicide drones.\"\nIn addition to that, Hezbollah has hundreds of unmanned aircraft, some of them attack drones, without significant flight and precision capabilities, while others are used for the collection of intelligence and for psychological warfare.\nIt also has between 80,000-100,000 rockets in ranges of 10 to 500 kilometers, but these rockets are not very accurate.\nNevertheless, the Israeli defense establishment views Hezbollah has the biggest threat to Israel at present.\nIsraeli defense officials believe Hezbollah has changed its approach with regards to future conflicts with Israel: Instead of a drawn-out war of attrition, like the 2006 Second Lebanon War, the Lebanese terror group would prefer a short war, with a strong opening blow, heavy barrages of rockets, and much subterfuge.\nThis kind of attitude would require a different approach from the IDF, focusing on the maneuvering of small forces, such as companies and platoons, rather than the cumbersome maneuvering of divisions.\nBut while the Iranians are urging their Lebanese proxy to escalate the situation with Israel, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah doesn't follow Tehran's orders completely, in part because of the bad shape his organization is currently in.\nAt the same time, Iran is continuing its efforts to increase its influence in Syria. Tehran is arming pro-Iranian forces fighting alongside the Syrian army with a massive airlift of some 100 flights a month.\nThe Islamic republic also seeks to establish a division in Syria under Hezbollah's command, gathering under one central command the tens of thousands of pro-Iranian fighters operating in the war-torn country. There are currently some 8,000 Hezbollah fighters, 1,500 Iranian Revolutionary Guards troops and some 10,000 Shiite militiamen in Syria.\nSee all talkbacks \"Israel fears Hezbollah will receive precision-guided missiles developed by Iran\""

It should decrease length of stay and wait times.\nBrennan and Schandelson said there were no major difficulties, as far as construction goes.\nThey said the funniest thing they found was walls and stairs that weren\u2019t on blueprints, but instances like this were easy to deal with because of the weekly meeting with construction.\nBrennan gave props to the staff after saying they had the brunt of the construction craziness.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve moved supplies and we\u2019ve moved people, and we\u2019ve been divided at one point,\u201d she said.\nSchandelson added that during a time of construction and changes, the staff stepped up.\nLet\u2019s get some of the new features of this project the staff of Benefis are extremely proud of.\nThe building hasn\u2019t had a family room for two years because even prior to breaking ground, Benefis had to re-purpose the room.\n\u201cWe get to have a family room again which is something our community really needs,\u201d said Schandelson.\nThey have put new technology in the room, a type of smart board, that allows patients and their family, no matter the distance, to make decisions together.\nThe board has a high-definition camera and sends a link and invite for those away to join the conversation. This allows them to be able to work around weather conditions and distance.\n\u201cThe room is also behind double doors. It decreases the noise, so families can remove themselves for a few minutes from the chaos of whatever the situation is.\nWhen Benefis had the opportunity to rebuild, it worked with the Sexual Assault Response Team because the hospital knew it would need space.\n\u201cThis room was built around all of [local] agencies coming together and saying, \u2018We just need something a little bit more if you have the space,' and so we found the space,\u201d he said.\nThe room is safe and windowless featuring a forensic interview room. The victim or survivor of sexual assault can sit here and tell their story to their nurse privately without having to sit uncomfortably in a bed in stirrups.\n\u201cWe try to preserve dignity the whole way through and try to decrease traumatization while we\u2019re taking care of the patient,\u201d said Schandelson.\nAfter the interview room, they can move next door to the exam room.\nThe room has high-end technology, including a $21,000 digital camera provided by donors.\nThe digital camera has a forensic level filter and special lighting. The images cannot be manipulated.\nThe clothing of the victim is collected by the staff and all the data is encrypted onto a drive on its own discrete, hack proof network. Then, when and if the survivors choose to prosecute, they can request the password protected CD.\nThe final touch of the room is the private bathroom.\n\u201cWhen the victim survivor is done, we never had a [private] shower or a place to freshen up or a place to put on clean clothes,\u201d said Schandelson.\nNow there is an enclosed bathroom, so the staff doesn\u2019t have to take the patient across the halls. They can stay in the room.\n\u201cIt\u2019s designed for the patient and the staff,\u201d said Brennan.\nThe two rooms are stainless steel wrapped and resemble a jail; however, they are designed to keep the patients safe.\nEverything is anti-ligature from top to bottom. From room to bathroom.\nIt\u2019s easily cleanable thanks to the room being \u201cflushable.\u201d The entire room can be hosed down, cleaned and drained.\nThe lights can be lowered to avoid glares against the steel, and the rooms are video monitored.\nThe rooms also include their own private bathroom for the convenience of the patients and staff. No more need for escorted trips to the restroom.\n\u201cThese are people that might be with us for a little while that just had a really bad night, and they want to clean themselves up so that whole shower system is anti-ligature too,\u201d said Schandelson.\nThe building has never had a garage before.\nIt holds four ambulances and connects right to the helipads.\nThere are two helipads outside a set of automatic, double-doors. Now, when people come in, they don\u2019t have to keep moving the helicopter.\nThe two pads also save money for upkeep and gas.\nThe garage also includes a separate shower area in case of patients come in with contamination.\nThe Benefis emergency department is located on the corner of 11th Avenue South and 28th Street South on the Benefis East Campus, open 24 hours a day."

So how personal is a lyric like that?\n``Paul observes us; he knows what we're like,'' Linda Bull says with a mischievous laugh. She says they let it be known they were looking for songs, and before they knew it they had offers from some of Australia's finest: Cummings, Jeff Burstin, Rob Snarski, Barry Palmer and Caroline Kennedy, Cyndi Boste, Chris Wilson, David McCormack, Dan Brodie and David Hosking. ``We said we wanted the songs to have country instrumentation, with violins, mandolins and pedal steel, but other than that there was no theme. We knew once the songs came in, a theme would develop.'' Is there an art to interpreting other people's songs? ``We only listen to them once or twice, to get the gist and the words, and then we do the melody and everything from memory, so we come up with our own version,'' Linda says.\nThe Bull sisters released the album independently after they were let go by their label, FMR, and Linda says it allowed them more freedom. ``We've always been conscious of budgets and working quickly anyway, because we didn't want to get in debt or waste someone else's opportunity. But this time we borrowed an amount of money from our mum and dad that we knew we could repay, for the recording, rather than from the record company.

A promoter took advantage of the fact that dozens of quality northern hemisphere bands made it to the Mount Fuji festival in Japan each July and thought he would entice them to Australia for the Splendour in the Grass festival in Byron Bay. So this week we get to see bands play material from some of the best albums of recent months.

Unfortunately, Big Star look too pricey for Meredith, but some other great acts are being considered, and fingers crossed for Brian Wilson in December.\nThe band formerly known as Shihad, Pacifier have shown with recent single Comfort Me that they've gained a stadium-rock sheen while recording with producer Josh Abraham (Korn, Limp Bizkit) in LA, but they've lost none of their melodic power. But other bands continue to take the mickey out of them for changing their name. First, Frenzal Rhomb claimed they were changing their name to Shihad to capitalise on the band's hard work in the US, and now a band calling themselves Jihad Against America are playing at - wait for it - an Access TV/Food Not Bombs benefit at Pony on Wednesday. A spokesman says the band aren't concerned about their controversial name. ``It's clear a jihad (holy war) has been declared, and the United States are the prime target.

While the coordinates derived from the cellphone call failed to lead the helicopter crew to the pair, a resourceful CHP dispatcher using the family name found a Facebook post where the father identified the trail they would be hiking on Sunday.\nA CHP helicopter crew eventually found Jake on the cliff overlooking his father\u2019s precarious position. Meanwhile, another CHP helicopter piloted by CHP officer-pilot Pete Gavitte arrived to start the rescue.\nWhile Gavitte kept the helicopter hovering over the boy, Officer Craig Koyl lowered officer-paramedic Schmidt to pick up the youngster.\nOnce the boy was hoisted and flown to a nearby landing site, the crew went back for his father. Koyl once again lowered Schmidt, this time into the tree on the cliff side. Schmidt then bandaged and prepared the father for a hoist in a rescue basket.\nSchmidt and two firefighter rescuers from Vacaville Fire Protection District who had climbed the cliff side helped secure the patient to the back board.

        "output": "that the quota, which puts a ceiling of 2.3 million vehicles on exports to the United States for the year ending in March, was no longer necessary. The executives said that the strengthening of the yen against the dollar, which makes Japanese products more expensive in the United States, would prevent them from selling many additional cars on the American market.\nIn the past year, the yen has risen by more than 35 percent against the dollar. Many Japanese manufacturers have raised prices to make up for the shift in exchange rates, while others have cut profit margins to keep prices steady and maintain their markets.\nJapanese exports of cars, trucks and buses to the United States in the first six months of this year rose by 18.4 percent from the corresponding period last year, to 1,706,597 vehicles.\nIn a separate development, an official of the Nissan Motor Company, Japan's second-largest auto maker after Toyota, said Nissan would start increasing its imports of United States auto parts this month.\nThe Nissan official, Kenkichi Shibata, said the company would import 20,000 sealed beams a month, to be used in 10,000 trucks, from the GTE Products Corporation of Stamford, Conn. He refused to disclose the value of the parts.\nNissan's American subsidiary uses parts from GTE Products, ''so we know their products are reliable and of good quality,'' Mr. Shibata said.\nThe United States has long pressed Japanese auto makers to purchase more American-made auto parts. The Japanese, however, traditionally rely on long-term links with their affiliated suppliers, and foreign competitors argue that such close business relationships exclude them from selling in Japan. American sales here amount to less than 1 percent of the auto parts market. END OF QUOTA DOUBTED Top American auto makers expressed doubts yesterday that Japan would accede to the request of its automobile industry that the voluntary export quota be lifted.\nThe Ford Motor Company said that even with the voluntary restraints, Japanese auto makers had been expanding their share of the American market because of their increasing assembly capacity in this country. The General Motors Corporation declined to comment.\nMeanwhile, the United States trade representative's office said that export restraints, voluntary or imposed, were not the answer to the current trade problem with Japan. ''The U.S. has not asked for the restraints and has always maintained that the only answer is for Japan to open its markets to U.S. products,'' said Gary Holmes, a spokesman."

Volunteer teams rigged cameras",

Now the team is seeking help from the public to process this tsunami of data.\nThere has perhaps not been a more important time to hone our understanding of the current state of ecological health and function of the Wasatch Mountains and the wildlife that live here.\nThe Wasatch sustains 9 million visitors a year, which is about the same as that of the \u201cmighty five\u201d Utah national parks. Currently many planning processes and opportunities to shape the future of the central Wasatch are unfolding, ranging from the Central Wasatch National Conservation and Recreation Area legislation, transportation solutions from the recent blue print of the Central Wasatch Mountain Accord, and other national forest planning opportunities.\nThe greater Salt Lake area is predicted to experience a 40 percent increase in human population in the next 25 years, and with that will come predictable increases in human pressure on this fragile range.\nAt the same time, and like never before, our state and federal land and wildlife management agencies have their budgets slashed, hiring frozen and staff worked thin. Without proper resources, our public lands and wildlife resources are at serious risk of being degraded and diminished. We need the community\u2019s help to protect our critical natural resources and natural heritage.\nCommunity Scientists (also known as Citizen Scientists) are community members that are trained to collect data. They don\u2019t need a degree or expertise, just dedication. With the data Community Scientists collect, we can positively affect our public lands and wildlife.\nWildlife in the Wasatch Mountains live in one of the most highly-trafficked national forests in the country and next to one of the fastest growing cities in the nation. Yet, we know very little about what Wasatch wildlife need to sustain their populations. This year, a partnership including the University of Utah, Wild Utah Project, Utah Natural History Museum and more than 200 Community Scientists began studying the Wasatch\u2019s wildlife with the goal of learning about critical habitats and movement corridors.\nCommunity Scientists deployed trail cameras and are now helping analyze nearly a million images including moose, elk, mule deer, and cougar. Each image will be used to understand the most important habitats and movement pathways for these animals. The study is designed to help us learn how current human activities and influences in the Wasatch are affecting these habitats and pathways. This will help better inform management of not only our Wasatch wildlife, but also the transportation and other planning solutions that are underway, thus helping these projects avoid impacts to our wildlife.\nWithout Community Scientists, research like the Wasatch wildlife study is not possible. Leveraging Community Science to collect crucial information on ecological data gaps is a win-win for local stakeholders and land and wildlife management agencies alike. Especially now, as agency budgets are so lean and conservation science is sometimes given short shrift, we think the positive partnerships grounded in volunteer Community Science efforts can help bridge these gaps, fostering positive results for Utah\u2019s natural resources.\nWe encourage you to be a Community Scientist and help play a role in conserving our natural heritage. Learn more at https://www.wildutahproject.org/citizen-science/ .\nAustin Green is a Ph.D. student in the Biodiversity and Conservation Ecology Lab at the University of Utah, studying how human activity affects wildlife occurrence and behavior.

Today, viewers and listeners place more than seven million TV and radio programme requests each day across the country, so by increasing the window to 30 days this can only lead to an increase in viewing (and perhaps binge-watching).\nIt\u2019s worth noting here that some programmes, including Panorama, Question Time, Click, and Prime Minister\u2019s Questions are available for up to a year, with some shows in BBC Four Collections available for even longer. Conversely, for contractual reasons, some programming will still only be available for less than 30 days, including Crimewatch and Match of the Day (boooo).\n\u201cThere is a huge demand to make programmes available for longer on BBC iPlayer \u2013 as we continue to see people search for their favourite programmes after the seven-day catch up window,\u201d explains Ralph Rivera, Director of Future Media at the BBC.\nGiven that you can also download content for offline consumption for up to 30 days, today\u2019s move effectively means you currently have 2 months to watch all BBC content (e.g. if you were to download a show on the last day of the initial catch-up window). But unfortunately, this will soon be changing to a flat 30 days from the moment of broadcast, meaning downloads will be brought into line with streaming and the time restrictions will run concurrently.\nPerhaps the next big evolution in the BBC iPlayer story will be when it finally launches the commercial BBC Store offering, letting you pay to download and keep shows for good. Though there is still no word on when this will be unveiled."

        "input": "Lucasfilm was kind enough to provide us with a Q and A with Frank Oz, the man behind Yoda, to discuss his thoughts on the character and bringing him back to \"Star Wars: Rebels.\"\nQ. What was your initial reaction to Yoda when you viewed the concept sketches for the character",
        "output": "in 1979?\nA. When I saw the first sketches they were different from the Yoda we now know. But still, I sensed who he was right away. That rarely happens, but it happened with him.\nQ. Do you remember what George Lucas said to you to inspire you to come up with the voice that you chose for Yoda?\nA. Actually George didn\u2019t ask me to do the voice. I gave him a voice tape early on but I was told he wanted to try other people doing the voice. Over the year or so while post was going on, I would hear that many men were auditioned for Yoda\u2019s voice. But at the last minute, when I was on my honeymoon in Hawaii with my first wife, I got a call that George would like to use my voice after all. So we shortened the honeymoon and I went to LA to record Yoda for EMPIRE. But to answer your question, I studied old men\u2019s voices.\nQ. You reportedly created your own personal backstory for Yoda in 1979 to help you get into character. Is that true? Do you still have those notes?\nA. I may have them deep in storage\u2026somewhere. The content was about Yoda\u2019s history. His likes and dislikes. How he came to be on Dagobah. How Jedi behaved hundreds of years ago, etc. And also the notes included what Yoda knew about various people. What he knew about Luke, what he knew about Princess Leia, what he knew about Han Solo, and what he knew about Darth Vader. What he knew about all the characters impacted by the Force. I had asked George early on in the rehearsal period of The Empire Strikes Back, to let me have the whole script instead of having just my scenes. I felt if Yoda was so wise I needed to know what was going on throughout the script so Yoda could sense it all.\nQ. You've created so many wonderful characters over the years---how difficult or easy was Yoda compared to others you've created?\nA. Creating characters is really not about one person. Yoda was designed by someone, built by someone, costumed by someone, described and had dialogue written by someone (George and Lawrence Kasdan), and directed by Kersh (Director, Irvin Kershner). What I do is take all the elements, plus what\u2019s inside me, and bring them to life with, hopefully, a transformational and transcendent result. That\u2019s what happens with all the characters I\u2019ve originated.\nAs I said I sensed who Yoda was right away when I saw the sketches, but what was different with Yoda is that he was not performing for an audience. I had to havehim truthful to the script. And the major physical difference was that I had to have three people working him with me - all needing to be in exact sync with each other. That was really the challenging part - but the fun part too.\nQ. How does it feel to be reprising the voice of Yoda for Rebels after nearly ten years?\nA. It was wonderful to be him again.\nQ. How did you like working with Dave Filoni, EP/Supervising Director of Star Wars Rebels?\nA. Dave was great. He \u201cgot it.\u201d We worked well together.\nQ. What is your favorite Yoda line from the Star Wars movies?\nA. I don\u2019t really have a favorite. Although I liked reaching for the gravitas when Yoda says to Luke, \u201cYou will be. You will be,\u201d after Luke says he\u2019s not scared. I love opposites in characters. At first glance, Yoda is an impish character, but when he speaks of anything having to do with the Force he becomes profoundly serious. That paradox is interesting to me. One doesn\u2019t expect that kind of gravitas from a character that small and impish.\nRecognizing it\u2019s time for Ezra to undertake his next important step in Jedi training, Kanan and his apprentice quest for an ancient Jedi Temple on Lothal. Once there, Ezra begins a series of Jedi tests and receives some unexpected guidance from Jedi Master Yoda.\nEzra\u2019s worst fears are revealed and Yoda returns when Star Wars Rebels airs at 9:00 p.m. ET/PT Monday, January 5th on Disney XD."

        "output": "the U.S., drew on personal data snatched from payday loan websites, Federal Trade Commission official Steven Baker said. Over a two year period, at least 20 million calls may have been placed, with phony collectors typically demanding around $500 but sometimes asking for as much as $2,000.\nThe investigation of a scam with so many millions of calls flooding in from India was a first of its kind, the FTC's Midwest director said. But Baker added that other similar scams are almost certainly up and running.\n\"We think this is just the tip of the iceberg,\" he said.\nJanLaree Dejulius, an administrative assistant from Las Vegas, said she agreed to transfer $763 after receiving a call in April 2010 from someone who knew details about her family and that one relative had taken a payday loan. She said she sent the money after the caller claimed he was himself a government official and that someone would come to arrest her at her workplace if she didn't pay up.\n\"I consider myself savvy, but I fell for it,\" the 57-year-old said at a news conference in Chicago. \"I was intimidated enough not to want to get arrested.\"\nThe schemers zeroed in on individuals who they must have understood weren't rich, she said.\n\"In a nice word: They are scum,\" she said. \"They go after the most vulnerable.\"\nSome victims were so intimidated by the callers \u2014 some of whom claimed they were agents of the nonexistent Federal Department of Crime and Prevention \u2014 they agreed to pay even though they knew that neither they nor any acquaintances had payday debts, said Baker.\nFrom 2010 to 2012, $5 million was paid in 17,000 transactions to accounts controlled by the alleged fraudsters, Baker said.\nBaker said the investigation was complex and many questions were still unanswered, including how callers obtained such a vast amount of payday-loan information. He said the FTC tried but failed to coordinate the investigation with Indian authorities.\nMany victims reported the callers had pronounced Indian accents, but others, like Dejulius, say their callers did not have accents. Baker said it is thought, however, that all the bogus debt calls were made from an unknown location in India.\nNo criminal charges have been filed. But the FTC charged Villa Park, Calif.-based American Credit Crunchers LLC, Ebeeze, LLC and their owner, Varang K. Thaker, with violating the FTC Act and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act in connection to the alleged scheme.\nThaker allegedly withdrew thousands of dollars paid by victims that ended up in his company accounts, though Baker said it wasn't clear if the overall scheme was directed primarily from California or India.\nAmerican Credit Crunchers or Ebeeze in Villa Park, Calif., did not have a current phone listing. There also was no listing for a Varang K. Thaker in the area.\nThaker hasn't responded to the allegations but would have a chance at a federal court hearing set for next week, Baker said."

Here is a table presented describing his findings.\nLater in the speech, Krueger cited well-known studies describing growing income inequality in the United States. His claim about a shrinking middle class, though, appears to be new. While researchers have in the past argued that the middle class is shrinking, both Democratic and Republican administrations have generally steered clear of giving an exact definition of the middle class. Apparently fearing that an exact definition could backfire on them if the economy performs poorly, administrations have vowed to defend the middle class but avoided specifics. Given the central role that the state of the middle class will play in the 2012 presidential campaign, all of that may be different this year. To me, that\u2019s a step forward.\nNet net, households are becoming more prosperous.\nMy study can be found at http://unrepentantcapitalist.blogspot.co m/, see the August 21, 2010 posting.\nThat\u2019s 2% drop per 10 years.

The data shows that the % of lower income households ($100k/yr) has increased.\nSo let\u2019s just put everyone on level ground, shall we? Then we will see exactly what socialism really means. Or perhaps you could look at the European nations which are now having trouble with that theory, that is, level ground, and ask them how they are doing. Our nation was built upon anyone being able to make money, and the small to large companies employ Americans. Let us NOT allow the government to be the largest employer. Otherwise, you will only see and vast majority with hands out for lattes and cigarettes.\nThe data shows that the income curve has flattened, with the center \u201chump\u201d in the curve shrinking. In other words, the middle of the distribution is decreasing as a percentage of the population.\nIt is interesting that, if you place the \u201clower income\u201d threshold at $100,000. per year, the lower income threshold is about double the US household median income.\nJust as a matter of brutal fact, for those of you who are not \u201clower income\u201d, this country belongs to that lower income group. You have no property rights, no residence rights, no citizenship rights that are not granted by them. Ownership is merely a name on a piece of paper. That name can be changed. Participation in the political system is an \u201centitlement\u201d just as subject to change as any other \u201centitlement\u201d.\nCaution is advised. Promoting the benefits of allowing a capitalist system would be wise. Disparaging class based remarks are just plain stupid and antagonistic.\nThis country is not run by, or for the benefit, of organizations.\nI don\u2019t like the \u201csawn-off\u201d graph though.

The plant would be able to receive trash via rail as well as truck.\nThe parcel is not far from other depot property that is now known as Deer Haven Park, a preserve for the depot's famous white deer and a military history tourism destination.\nThe parcel where the new facility would go is owned by a company controlled by Rochester developer David Flaum, though the project is being undertaken by an unrelated company, Circular enerG LLC.\n\"We just think it\u2019s a great project and it\u2019s a really neat feature for handling solid waste,\" said Circular enerG' s counsel, Alan Knauf, a well-known environmental lawyer in Rochester.\nKnauf said the facility, which would be opened in 2021 at the earliest, is preferable to landfills because it controls odors and captures the energy potential in trash.\nMany landfills do collect methane from rotting waste and burn it to generate electricity, but do not do so as efficiently as the waste-to-energy plant would, Knauf said.\nCircular enerG, incorporated just 11 months ago, is affiliated with Top Capital of New York, with which it shares a downtown Rochester office. That firm is best known locally for a controversial proposal to turn the historic Rochester seminary near Highland Park into a luxury hotel.\nThe company or its affiliates also are involved in senior-housing projects in Brockport and Saratoga Springs, and an undertaking to manufacture LED lights or fixtures in Rochester.\nTop Capital's promotional material cites its use of funding obtained through the EB-5 program, which offers legal residency in the United States to citizens of foreign countries who invest at least $500,000 in a development project.\nKnauf said the fact that Circular enerG has no track record, let alone experience in solid-waste management, can be considered a plus.\n\"Getting somebody new in the industry that is entrepreneurial \u2014 that wants to do something positive and in line with global climate-change policy \u2014 that\u2019s a good thing,\" he said.\nCircular enerG submitted its proposal to the planning board in the Seneca County town of Romulus about 10 days ago, said William Karlsen, the board's vice chair. He said he knew nothing about the company except that it was from the Rochester area.\n\"This is so new to us. It\u2019s an incinerator design that\u2019s been used overseas. This is almost like the first one in the United States. It\u2019s a new technology.\" Karlsen said. \"It sounds too good to be true, but my ears are open. I don\u2019t know everything. I want to hear about it. Let\u2019s hear them out.\"\nKarlsen noted, though, that \"there\u2019s already opposition mounting now that this is public.\"\nSeveral online news outlets have publicized the proposal in recent days, including a blog about environmental affairs in the Finger Lakes, Water Front. The blogger, Peter Mantius, published a document from the Circular enerG proposal late last week.\nNews that a company wants to bring an additional 2,600 tons of trash each day to the Finger Lakes for disposal is likely to be unpopular with some quarters.\nThe region already is home to four of the state's 10 largest landfills, and there have been repeated protests and litigation over expansion proposals at three of them. At present, residents are voicing complaints over odor issues at the landfills in Seneca County and the Monroe County town of Perinton.\nWaste-burning incinerators also bring concerns about toxic constituents in smokestack emissions and ash. There were lengthy debates about incinerator proposals in Ontario and other Finger Lakes counties in the 1980s, but the proposals were never carried out.\nKnauf said solid waste would be unloaded inside the hulking structure and odors would not escape outside. He also said the plant would be able to meet modern standards for conventional and toxic air pollutants.\nDennis Money, president of the group that runs Deer Haven Park, said he learned about the incinerator proposal Monday morning.\n\"My initial concern was, first of all, why do we need one there between two of the most beautiful Finger Lakes,\" he said, referring to the lakes that bound the county on east and west, Cayuga and Seneca.\n\"We need to find out more about it, but on the surface of it, I would be against it personally,\" Money said.\nThe Seneca County location was chosen, Knauf said, because the former depot property offers land appropriate for industrial development, utilities, and rail and road connections.\nTrash would be imported to the site from distant locations such as New York City, as it already is to several of the large local landfills. Eventually, it might replace those landfills when their permits expire, Knauf said.\nThe state Department of Environmental Conservation, which would have to issue one or more permits to the company, said it had met with Circular enerG officials \"to discuss New York's rigorous permitting process, should the project proceed.\"\nBut no permit applications had been filed as of Monday, DEC spokesman Kevin Frazier said.\nThere are nine permitted solid-waste incinerators in New York according to 2016 annual reports filed with the DEC. The nearest are in suburban Syracuse and Niagara Falls."

And this was to an extent understandable, for the man, during his acting career in India, was mainly known for playing the charming, often vulnerable romantic hero. Shashi did try his hand at a few macho rules, but he for the most part remained the slightly dreamy Prince Charming rather than a swashbuckling pirate figure.\nWhat not too many people however realise is that Shashi Kapoor was much more than that. Balbir Prithivraj Kapoor (yes, that was his real name) was perhaps the only mainstream Bollywood film star to seriously work on the \u201cart\u201d side of cinema even when he was doing well commercially \u2013 he worked in films like Junoon, Kalyug, New Delhi Times and Utsav. And while most of the Hindi film world remembers him as Deewar\u2019s Ravi Varma who memorably told his brother Vijay, \u201cMere paas Ma hai,\u201d not too many know that he won the National Award for being the producer of the best film in 1978 (Junoon) and also a Filmfare Award for best film in 1980, Kalyug. He was also the first Indian actor to make his presence felt on the international scene with films like Siddharth, Shakespeare Wallah, the Householder and Heart and Dust.\nYes, Shashi Kapoor was a romantic hero (and occasionally an action-oriented one), but he also did not shy away from playing other roles \u2013 he played the villain in Utsav and a middle-aged father in Vijeeta, at a time when he was still playing the dashing hero in other films. He played a middle-aged editor in New Delhi Times and won a National Award for acting. And even towards the end of his career, he was still capable to producing stunning performances, perhaps most noticeably in Muhafiz/ In Custody (1993), where he plays an ageing poet. He was also the producer of films like Kalyug, Vijeta, Utsav, Junoon and 36 Chowringhee Lane, each of which can hold its own as a masterpiece. He was one of those rare personalities who dabbled in both commercial and art cinema, Indian and international cinema, and acting and cinema production with equal ease.\nAnd at the end of it all, most people seemed to just remember him as \u201cHandsome.\u201d Yes, he was very good looking, but remembering Shashi Kapoor as Handsome is akin to remembering the Taj Mahal as a fancy tomb. The surface was handsome indeed, but what lay behind it and the foundations on which it was built were about more than just skin-deep beauty.\nMind you, he was partly to blame for the other side of his remaining unknown. For whatever he was, Shashi Kapoor was not tainted by conceit or arrogance. Whatever he did beyond his \u2018normal\u2019 Bollywood commercial roles, he did so without creating an undue fuss. This was, after all, the man who had once said that if his family had not gone into theatre, he would have probably working at a clothes shop as a \u2018Darbaan\u2019 (door keeper).\nSo, it is perhaps apt that my abiding memory of Shashi Kapoor is not that of a Bollywood hero, but of the man who came to attend a party at a Defence Officers\u2019 Mess and then disappeared from the middle of it. A frantic search for him was launched but he did not seem to be on the premises. Even while some people wondered if he had run off with some young lady (\u201cthese Bollywood types are all womanisers, you know\u201d), he was ultimately discovered, sitting happily in the kitchen, chatting with the cooks and waiters.\nShashi Kapoor was indeed handsome.\nBut not because he was just good looking.\nHe was handsome as in handsome does."

Throughout the long 36 years, it has proved to the world of performing arts that sans so-called professionalism, theater workers of this country have been able to create an ambiance of professional skill in theatre. In fact,",
        "output": "to be an affiliate with a world organization like ITI, professional theatre practice is one of the basic conditions. But Bangladesh group theatre practice, even being amateurish, possesses so much of rectitude and missionary zeal that ITI Worldwide has been positively convinced to recognize its professionalism and subsequently grab the membership.\nSo, that's Bangladesh where language and culture are deeply rooted and where people's cultural amateurism is inherently their professionalism. Same attributes mirror in the ITI Bangladesh Centre. The Centre has been holding different theatrical events, festivals and workshops liaising with the ITI Worldwide and other centers globally.\nBangladesh regularly attends ITI World Congress, and in the last 35th Congress held in Segovia, Spain in 2017, Bangladesh had the highest participation so far. For easy and smooth functioning of ITI Worldwide, five main bodies have been formed, and they are: Artistic, Educational, Humanitarian, Research, Documentation & Promotion, and Collaboration Project. There are a total of fifteen sub-committees under those divisions and Bangladesh has always represented significantly as Board Members of those committees. Presently the following persons are members of the committees mentioned against their names: Irine Parvin Lopa, International Monodrama Forum; Abdus Selim and Sadhana Ahmed: International Playwrights' Forum; Sayik Siddiquee: Network of Emerging Arts Professional; Abdus Selim: International Stage Directors Network: Shafi Ahmed & Israfil Shaheen: Forum Theatre Training & Education; Abdus Selim: Action Committee for Artist Rights; Nasiruddin Yousuff Bachchu: Network for Heritage, Indigenous Culture & Migration; and, Babul Biswas (Committee Secretary) & Mofidul Hoque (Member), ITI Publications Committee. Ramendu Majumdar's election to ITI Worldwide Presidency for two consecutive terms is an added success story.\nAs stated by Nasiruddin Yousuff Bachchu, present President, ITI Bangladesh, from the 1st Dhaka International Theatre Fest 2012 the Centre has been trying to go by the event-calendar. One other routine event of the Centre happens to be the Monodrama Festival. So far two Monodrama Festivals were held with tremendous success \u2013 one in 2011 and the other in 2016. But it is really strenuous enough for an organization run by mere voluntary efforts to stick to the calendar.\nThe person who has been responsible for executing the Centre's all functions pragmatically for last five years is Debaprasad Debnath, General Secretary, ITI Bangladesh. His expertise and in-built skill for running an organization has put the Centre at an admirable height. A few days back he briefed me about the two-day celebration of 70 years of ITI by the Centre in October 2018. Among a wide range of events it contains songs of Bangla plays, folk drama festival, seminar, documentation of 70 years of ITI Worldwide and 36 years of ITI Bangladesh, documentaries, and many more. Another important member of the Centre is Prof. Shafi Ahmed who almost singlehandedly and tirelessly has taken the challenges of all publication works of the Centre. On the other hand, Ramendu Majumdar and Mofidul Hoque have been co-editing the prestigious journal of the ITI Worldwide The World of Theatre for over twenty years now. The journal is published from Bangladesh.\nOne great thing has happened because of ITI's activities in Bangladesh. Babul Biswas, a veteran theatre activist, has been enthused to develop an archive by the name Bangladesh Theatre Archive by means of his individual effort. The present write up is deeply indebted to the archive for some relevant information provided. No doubt ITI Bangladesh Centre has been playing a crucial role in the realms of theatre both at home and abroad for long 36 years. Vive ITI Bangladesh Centre!"

Upon completing the workshop, the teachers become deputy registrars with the legal authority to sign up voters.\nEach March, the school system runs a computer search to find the names and class schedules of all the students in the county who will be eligible to register to vote in the coming year. (In Florida, citizens can register six months before their 18th birthday but cannot vote until they are 18.) The central office then sends voter registration forms, along with a list of the students in each social studies class eligible to register, to each school's social studies chairman.

Britton was the superintendent of the Dade County schools when they established their program.\nLouise Altman, New York director of Human SERVE, a national organization that promotes voter participation, says her group is making a major push to get urban school systems to adopt voter registration programs similar to Dade's.

Now we highlight. \u201cWe need to create a 3D effect on the face, so we need to play lighter colors against darker for the right look. I use a shimmery light powder just above the contour on the cheeks,\u201d says Shackleton. For lighter to medium skin tones, try a silvery shimmer and for medium to darker tones, use a warmer gold shimmer.\nStep 4: Hit the areas inside the oval with shimmer. Remember, just as we are trying to diminish areas of the face outside the oval with contour, we need to pop out the areas inside to make them appear bigger!\nStep 5: Finish off the apples of your cheeks with your favorite blush and blend everything together. You\u2019ll see a significant improvement, and if you don\u2019t get it the first time, just keep blending and practicing. Take a selfie before and after to see the difference!"

For more information, please contact Archana Verma, (650) 721 - 1713.\nThe investigators hope to learn 1) if the addition of prophylaxis with vancomycin will decrease the rate of cefazolin non-susceptible surgical site infections (SSI), in high risk population 2) to develop better understanding of vancomycin and cefazolin pharmacokinetics in children undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) 3) to assess the barriers to vancomycin dosing peri-operatively 4) to assess side effects and risks associated with peri-operative vancomycin administration. This will allow us to improve patient care by better understanding the benefits or the risks of peri-operative vancomycin administration and potentially decrease cefazolin-resistant surgical site infections. In addition, this study gives us the opportunity to evaluate cefazolin and vancomycin pharmacokinetics (pK) on children on CPB. The investigators will take blood samples from 20 patients. In 10 patients the investigators will do Cefazolin pK analysis and in the other 10 the investigators will do pK Vancomycin analysis. For the remainder of 292 patients, only prospective chart review will be done to determine the incidence of SSIs. This data will be compared with 936 controls who received only Cefazolin pre-operatively as prophylaxis for SSI's.\nStanford is currently not accepting patients for this trial.

However, hypotension has been reported with the use of ferumoxytol for indications other than cardiac MRI. The purpose of our investigation was to evaluate the safety of ferumoxytol in children undergoing general anaesthesia for cardiac MRI.METHODS: Medical records of children undergoing general anaesthesia for cardiac MRI were reviewed. Baseline demographic and medical characteristics, as well as imaging and anaesthetic duration and technique, were collected. The incidence of hypotension or other adverse events', need for vasoactive support, or airway intervention throughout the anaesthetic, was recorded.RESULTS: A total of 95 patients were identified, 61 received ferumoxytol and 34 received gadolinium. There were no significant differences between groups with respect to age, weight, or baseline blood pressure. The incidence of low blood pressure - systolic or mean - after contrast administration did not differ between groups, and there was no difference in sustained hypotension or use of vasopressors between groups. One patient who received ferumoxytol had possible anaphylaxis. The image acquisition time (45 versus 68 min, p=0.002) and anaesthesia duration (100 versus 132 min, p=0.02) were shorter in the ferumoxytol group.CONCLUSION: Transient low blood pressure was common in children undergoing cardiac MRI with anaesthesia, but the incidence of hypotension did not differ between ferumoxytol and gadolinium groups. The use of ferumoxytol was associated with significantly shorter scan time and anaesthesia duration, as well as a decreased need for airway intervention.\nAs physicians and caregivers of children with congenital heart disease, we are aware of the increasing need for procedures requiring anesthesia. While these procedures may be ideal for medical and cardiac surgical management, the risks and benefits must be assessed carefully. There are well known risks of cardiovascular and respiratory complications from anesthesia and sedation and a potentially under-appreciated risk of neurocognitive dysfunction. Both animal and human studies support the detrimental effects of repeated anesthetic exposure on the developing brain. Although the studies in humans are less convincing of this risk, the Society of Pediatric Anesthesia jointly with SmartTots provided a consensus statement on the use of anesthetic and sedative drugs in infants and toddlers when speaking to families. (www.pedsanesthesia.org; http://smarttots.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ConsensusStatementV910.5.2015.pdf). An excerpt of the statement is \"Concerns regarding the unknown risk of anesthetic exposure to your child's brain development must be weighed against the potential harm associated with cancelling or delaying a needed procedure. Each child's care must be evaluated individually based on age, type, and urgency of the procedure and other health factors. This review provides a summary of the current evidence regarding anesthesia-induced neurotoxicity and the developing brain and its implications for children with congenital heart disease.\nDuring a pulmonary hypertensive crisis, the marked increase in pulmonary vascular resistance can result in acute right ventricular failure and death. Currently, there are no therapeutic guidelines for managing an acute crisis. This pilot study examined the hemodynamic effects of phenylephrine, arginine vasopressin, and epinephrine in pediatric patients with pulmonary hypertension.In this prospective, open-label, nonrandomized pilot study, we enrolled pediatric patients previously diagnosed with pulmonary hypertensive who were scheduled electively for cardiac catheterization. Primary outcome was a change in the ratio of pulmonary-to-systemic vascular resistance. Baseline hemodynamic data were collected before and after the study drug was administered.Eleven of 15 participants were women, median age was 9.2 years (range, 1.7-14.9 yr), and median weight was 26.8 kg (range, 8.5-55.2 kg). Baseline mean pulmonary artery pressure was 49 \u00b1 19 mm Hg, and mean indexed pulmonary vascular resistance was 10 \u00b1 5.4 Wood units. Etiology of pulmonary hypertensive varied, and all were on systemic pulmonary hypertensive medications.Patients 1-5 received phenylephrine 1 \u03bcg/kg; patients 6-10 received arginine vasopressin 0.03 U/kg; and patients 11-15 received epinephrine 1 \u03bcg/kg. Hemodynamics was measured continuously for up to 10 minutes following study drug administration.After study drug administration, the ratio of pulmonary-to-systemic vascular resistance decreased in three of five patients receiving phenylephrine, five of five patients receiving arginine vasopressin, and three of five patients receiving epinephrine. Although all three medications resulted in an increase in aortic pressure, only arginine vasopressin consistently resulted in a decrease in the ratio of systolic pulmonary artery-to-aortic pressure.This prospective pilot study of phenylephrine, arginine vasopressin, and epinephrine in pediatric patients with pulmonary hypertensive showed an increase in aortic pressure with all drugs although only vasopressin resulted in a consistent decrease in the ratio of pulmonary-to-systemic vascular resistance. Studies with more subjects are warranted to define optimal dosing strategies of these medications in an acute pulmonary hypertensive crisis.\nPrior studies have shown inaccuracies in pulse oximetry readings at saturations less than 85%; however, no large studies have evaluated new sensors marketed for these low saturations. This study's purpose was to evaluate two sensors with claims of improved accuracy in children with saturations less than 85%.Prospective observational study.Single institution; cardiac catheterization laboratory, and operating room.Fifty patients weighing 3-20 kg with baseline saturations less than 90% undergoing surgical or catheterization procedure.Data collected included demographics, diagnosis, continuous saturations from three different pulse oximeters (Masimo LNCS [Masimo, Irvine, CA], Masimo Blue [Masimo], and Nellcor Max-I [Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland]) and up to four blood samples for co-oximetry as the gold-standard arterial oxygen saturation. Analysis included scatter plots, smoothed regression estimates of mean continuous saturation levels plotted against corresponding arterial oxygen saturation values, and Bland-Altman plots. Bland-Altman analysis indicated increasing levels of bias and variability for decreasing arterial oxygen saturation levels for all three sensors, with a statistically significant increase in mean difference observed for decreasing arterial oxygen saturation level. The Masimo Blue sensor had the lowest mean difference, SD and Bland-Altman limits in patients with saturations less than or equal to 85%. At saturation range of less than or equal to 85% and greater than 75%, 14% of the samples obtained from Masimo Blue, 24% of the readings from the Nellcor, and 31% from the Masimo Standard sensors were greater than or equal to 5% points difference. All three sensors had a further increase in these differences for arterial oxygen saturation values less than 75%.The Masimo Blue sensor has improved accuracy at saturations 75-85% versus the Nellcor and Masimo Standard sensors. The accuracy of peripheral capillary oxygen saturation of the Masimo Blue sensor was within 5% points of the arterial oxygen saturation the majority of the time. Currently, at saturations less than or equal to 85%, pulse oximetry alone should not be relied on in making clinical decisions.\nPrior investigations have suggested that the rapidly growing population of adults with congenital heart disease is at increased risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality, but information is limited on the nature of those perioperative factors that may relate to adverse outcomes. We sought to use a national claims database to describe the contribution of perioperative factors to adverse outcomes and compare contributing factors in cardiac vs. noncardiac operations.The study is a retrospective in-depth structured analysis of cases from the Anesthesia Closed Claims Project database.We examined the largest national anesthesia malpractice claims database.We included all claims cases involving adult patients with congenital heart disease (CHD).Patients in this retrospective analysis were classified by type of surgery (cardiac or noncardiac).Perioperative factors contributing to an adverse event were assessed by an expert panel of cardiac anesthesiologists.Of 21 confirmed cases, 11 (52%) involved cardiac procedures and 10 (48%) noncardiac procedures. The most common factors contributing to the adverse event in cardiac cases were surgical technique (73% of cases) and intraoperative anesthetic care (55%), whereas in noncardiac cases, postoperative monitoring/care (50%), CHD (50%) and preoperative assessment or optimization (40%) were most common. The factors contributing to the patient injury differed similarly: in cardiac cases, the most common factors were intraoperative anesthetic care (55%) and surgical technique (45%) compared with postoperative monitoring/care (50%) and CHD (50%) in noncardiac cases.Within the limitations of a small number of events in a claims-based database, this study offers advantages of being a national, structured analysis of real cases to provide detailed information on phenomena that are otherwise abstract and hypothesized by expert opinion. These results should help affirm the role of anesthesiologists in acquiring and executing expertise as consultants in perioperative medicine for adults with congenital heart disease patients.\nBACKGROUND: From 2002 to 2005, the interstage mortality after a modified Norwood procedure was 7% in our program. An interstage home monitoring program (HMP) was established to identify Norwood procedure patients at increased risk of decompensation and to reduce interstage mortality. METHODS: Results of the first 5 years of the Norwood HMP were reviewed retrospectively. Interstage was defined as the time between Norwood hospital discharge and admission for second stage surgical palliation. In the HMP, families documented oxygen saturation, heart rate, weight, and feedings daily. Nurse practitioners called each family at least weekly, and when issues arose, action plans were determined based on symptom severity. RESULTS: Between October 2005 and October 2010 there were 46 Norwood procedure patients who survived to hospital discharge. All were enrolled in the HMP. Forty-five patients had a Norwood procedure with right ventricle to pulmonary artery conduit, and 1 patient had a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt. Interstage survival was 100%. Nineteen patients (41%) were admitted interstage; 5 patients were admitted twice, 1 patient was admitted 4 times. Seventeen patients (37%) required interstage interventions. Eight patients (17%) required major interventions: conduit stenting, aortic arch balloon angioplasty, emergent shunt, or early Glenn surgery. Minor interventions included supplemental oxygen, blood transfusion, intravenous hydration, diuresis, anti-arrhythmic therapy, or feeding adjustments. CONCLUSIONS: In the first 5 years of the HMP, all infants discharged after a modified Norwood procedure survived the interstage period. The HMP altered clinical management in 37% of patients. Home monitoring of oxygen saturation, heart rate, weight, and feedings, along with comprehensive care coordination, allowed timely interventions and reduced interstage mortality from 7% to 0%.\nHome monitoring program reduces interstage mortality after the modified Norwood procedure JOURNAL OF THORACIC AND CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY Siehr, S. L., Norris, J. K., Bushnell, J. A., Ramamoorthy, C., Reddy, V. M., Hanley, F. L., Wright, G. E. 2014; 147 (2): 718-?\nOBJECTIVE: To examine the knowledge and attitudes of anesthesia providers in relation to the care of adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) patients presenting for noncardiac surgery. DESIGN/SETTING: A novel survey was designed and administered to 168 anesthesiologists across a single academic department in a range of practice environments. INTERVENTIONS: None. OUTCOME MEASURES: Survey responses, including true/false, multiple choice, and Likert scale questions. RESULTS: A total of 118 anesthesiologists (response rate = 70%) completed the survey. Knowledge scores ranged from 0 to 19 (median [interquartile range] = 7 [5-13]) out of a possible maximum of 20. Total knowledge scores differed significantly by fellowship background (P = .004), with higher scores in those with cardiac (11 [7-15], P = .005) and pediatric (12 [6-15], P = .001) fellowship training, but not in those with critical care, obstetric, regional, or pain management training. Scores also differed by frequency of providing care for cardiopulmonary bypass cases and frequency of providing care for patients under 2 years of age (P < .001 for both), but not by gender or years removed from residency. Respondents reported only moderate levels of comfort with a range of questions about providing perioperative or obstetric care to ACHD patients, with decreasing levels of comfort reported in patients with more complex lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Within the context of the limitations of a single-institution survey design, the low levels of knowledge and comfort we observed suggest that providers may benefit from improved training and protocols for ensuring adequate preparedness for the care of ACHD patients.\n: To describe volatile anesthesia (VA) use for pediatric asthma, including complications and outcomes.: Retrospective cohort study.: Children's hospitals contributing to the Pediatric Health Information System between 2004-2008.: Children 2-18 years old with a primary diagnosis code for asthma supported with mechanical ventilation.: Those treated with VA were compared to those not treated with VA or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Hospital VA use was grouped as none, <5%, 5-10% and >10% among intubated children.: One thousand five hundred and fifty-eight patients received mechanical ventilation at 40 hospitals for asthma: 47 (3%) received VA treatment at 11 (28%) hospitals. Those receiving a VA were significantly less likely to receive inhaled b-agonists, ipratropium bromide, and heliox, but more likely to receive neuromuscular blocking agents than patients treated without VA. Length of mechanical ventilation, hospital stay (length of stay [LOS]) and charges were significantly greater for those treated with VA. Aspiration was more common but death and air leak did not differ. Patients at hospitals with VA use >10% were significantly less likely to receive inhaled b agonist, ipratropium bromide, methylxanthines, and heliox, but more likely to receive systemic b agonist, neuromuscular blocking agents compared to those treated at hospitals not using VA. LOS, duration of ventilation, and hospital charges were significantly greater for patients treated at centers with high VA use.: Mortality does not differ between centers that use VA or not. Patients treated at centers with high VA use had significantly increased hospital charges and increased LOS.\nCerebral hypoxia-ischemia remains a complication in children with congenital heart disease. Near-infrared spectroscopy can be utilized at the bedside to detect cerebral hypoxia-ischemia. This study aimed to calibrate and validate an advanced technology near-infrared cerebral oximeter for use in children with congenital heart disease.After institutional review board approval and parental consent, 100 children less than 12 years and less than 40 kg were enrolled. Phase I (calibration) measured arterial and jugular venous saturation (SaO(2), SjO(2)) by co-oximetry simultaneously with device signals to calibrate an algorithm to determine regional cerebral saturation against a weighted average cerebral saturation (0.7 SjO(2) + 0.3 SaO(2)). Phase II (validation) evaluated regional cerebral saturation from the algorithm against the weighted average cerebral saturation by correlation, bias, precision, and A(Root Mean Square) assessed by linear regression and Bland-Altman analysis.Of 100 patients, 86 were evaluable consisting of 7 neonates, 44 infants, and 35 children of whom 55% were female, 79% Caucasian, and 41% with cyanotic disease. The SaO(2) and regional cerebral saturation ranged from 34% to 100% and 34% to 91%, respectively. There were no significant differences in subject characteristics between phases. For the entire cohort, A(RMS), bias, precision, and correlation coefficient were 5.4%, 0.5%, 5.39%, and 0.88, respectively. Age, skin color, and hematocrit did not affect these values.This cerebral oximeter accurately measures the absolute value of cerebral saturation in children over a wide range of oxygenation and subject characteristics, offering advantages in assessment of cerebral hypoxia-ischemia in congenital heart disease.\nVery low birth weight (VLBW) preterm infants are at risk for impaired cerebral autoregulation with pressure passive blood flow. Fluctuations in cerebral perfusion may occur in infants with a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (hsPDA), especially during ductal closure. Our goal was to compare cerebral autoregulation using near-infrared spectroscopy in VLBW infants treated for an hsPDA.This prospective observational study enrolled 28 VLBW infants with an hsPDA diagnosed by echocardiography and 12 control VLBW infants without an hsPDA. Near-infrared spectroscopy cerebral monitoring was applied during conservative treatment, indomethacin treatment, or surgical ligation. A cerebral pressure passivity index (PPI) was calculated, and PPI differences were compared using a mixed-effects regression model. Cranial ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging data were also assessed.Infants with surgically ligated hsPDAs were more likely to have had a greater PPI within 2 hours following ligation than were those treated with conservative management (P=.04) or indomethacin (P=.0007). These differences resolved by 6 hours after treatment.Cerebral autoregulation was better preserved after indomethacin treatment of an hsPDA compared with surgical ligation. Infants requiring surgical hsPDA ligation may be at increased risk for cerebral pressure passivity in the 6 hours following surgery.\nThe incidence and prevalence of adolescent obesity and adolescent heart failure are increasing, and anesthesiologists increasingly will encounter patients with both conditions. A greater understanding of the physiologic challenges of adolescent heart failure as they relate to the perioperative stressors of anesthesia and bariatric surgery is necessary to successfully manage the perioperative risks faced by this growing subpopulation. Here, we present a representative case of a morbidly obese adolescent with heart failure who underwent a laparoscopic bariatric operation and review the limited available literature on perioperative management in this age group. Specifically, we review evidence and offer recommendations related to preoperative evaluation, venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, positioning, induction, airway management, monitoring, anesthetic maintenance, ventilator management, and adverse effects of the pneumoperitoneum, rhabdomyolysis, and postoperative care.\nPreterm infants with a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (hsPDA) are at risk for fluctuations in cerebral blood flow, but it is unclear how different hsPDA treatment strategies may affect cerebral oxygenation.To compare regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO(2)) as measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants with a hsPDA treated with conservative management, indomethacin, or surgical ligation.This prospective observational study enrolled 33 VLBW infants with a hsPDA diagnosed by echocardiogram and 12 control VLBW infants without a hsPDA. Infants had NIRS cerebral monitoring applied prior to conservative treatment, indomethacin, or surgical ligation. Cranial ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging data were also collected.Infants undergoing surgical ligation had a greater time period with >20% change in rSO(2) from baseline (30%) compared to those receiving indomethacin (7.4%, p = 0.001) or control infants without a hsPDA (2.6%, p = 0.0004). NIRS measures were not associated with abnormal neuroimaging in this small cohort.These findings suggest that infants requiring surgical ligation for a hsPDA are at high risk for significant changes in cerebral oxygenation, whereas those receiving either indomethacin or conservative management maintain relatively stable cerebral oxygenation levels. Additional research is necessary to determine if NIRS monitoring identifies infants with a hsPDA at highest risk for brain injury.\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of temperature on cerebral oxygen metabolism at total body flow bypass and antegrade cerebral perfusion (ACP). Neonatal piglets were put on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with the initial flow rate of 200mL/kg/min. After cooling to 18\u00b0C (n=6) or 25\u00b0C (n=7), flow was reduced to 100mL/kg/min (half-flow, HF) for 15min and ACP was initiated at 40mL/kg/min for 45min. Following rewarming, animals were weaned from bypass and survived for 4h. At baseline, HF, ACP, and 4\u2003h post-CPB, cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured using fluorescent microspheres. Cerebral oxygen extraction (CEO(2) ) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO(2) ) were monitored. Regional cranial oxygen saturation (rSO(2) ) was continuously recorded throughout the procedure using near-infrared spectroscopy. At 18\u00b0C, CBF trended lower at HF and ACP and matched baseline after CPB. CEO(2) trended lower at HF and ACP, and trended higher after CPB compared with baseline. CMRO(2) at ACP matched that at HF. Cranial rSO(2) was significantly greater at HF and ACP (P<0.001, P<0.001) and matched baseline after CPB. At 25\u00b0C, CBF trended lower at HF, rebounded and trended higher at ACP, and matched baseline after CPB. CEO(2) was equal at HF and ACP and trended higher after CPB compared with baseline. CMRO(2) at ACP was greater than that at HF (P=0.001). Cranial rSO(2) was significantly greater at HF (P=0.01), equal at ACP, and lower after CPB (P=0.03). Lactate was significantly higher at all time points (P=0.036, P<0.001, and P<0.001). ACP provided sufficient oxygen to the brain at a total body flow rate of 100mL/kg/min at deep hypothermia. Although ACP provided minimum oxygenation to the brain which met the oxygen requirement, oxygen metabolism was altered during ACP at moderate hypothermia. ACP strategy at moderate hypothermia needs further investigation.\nFrom 1994 to 2005, the Pediatric Perioperative Cardiac Arrest Registry collected data on 373 anesthesia-related cardiac arrests (CAs) in children, 34% of whom had congenital or acquired heart disease (HD).Nearly 80 North American institutions that provide anesthesia for children voluntarily enrolled in the Pediatric Perioperative Cardiac Arrest Registry. A standardized data form for each perioperative CA in children 18 years old or younger was submitted anonymously. We analyzed causes of and outcomes from anesthesia-related CA in children with and without HD.Compared with the 245 children without HD, the 127 children with HD who arrested were sicker (92% vs 62% ASA physical status III-V; P < 0.01) and more likely to arrest from cardiovascular causes (50% vs 38%; P = 0.03), although often the exact cardiovascular cause of arrest could not be determined. Mortality was higher in patients with HD (33%) than those without HD (23%, P = 0.048) but did not differ when adjusted for ASA physical status classification. More than half (54%) of the CA in patients with HD were reported from the general operating room compared with 26% from the cardiac operating room and 17% from the catheterization laboratory. The most common category of HD lesion in patients suffering CA was single ventricle (n = 24). At the time of CA, most patients with congenital HD were either unrepaired (59%) or palliated (26%). Arrests in patients with aortic stenosis and cardiomyopathy were associated with the highest mortality rates (62% and 50%, respectively), although statistical comparison was precluded by small sample size for some HD lesions.Children with HD were sicker compared with those without HD at the time of anesthesia-related CA and had a higher mortality after arrest. These arrests were reported most frequently from the general operating room and were likely to be from cardiovascular causes. The identification of causes of and factors relating to anesthesia-related CA suggests possible strategies for prevention.\nAntegrade cerebral perfusion is widely used in neonatal heart surgery, yet commonly used flow rates have never been standardized. The objective of this study was to determine the antegrade cerebral perfusion flow rate that most closely matches standard cardiopulmonary bypass conditions.Nine neonatal piglets underwent deep hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass at a total body flow of 100 mL/kg/min (baseline). Antegrade cerebral perfusion was conducted via innominate artery cannulation at perfusion rates of 10, 30, and 50 mL/kg/min in random order. Cerebral blood flow was measured using fluorescent microspheres. Regional oxygen saturation and cerebral oxygen extraction were monitored.Cerebral blood flow was as follows: baseline, 60 +/- 17 mL/100 g/min; antegrade cerebral perfusion at 50 mL/kg/min, 56 +/- 17 mL/100 g/min; antegrade cerebral perfusion at 30 mL/kg/min, 36 +/- 9 mL/100 g/min; and antegrade cerebral perfusion at 10 mL/kg/min, 13 +/- 6 mL/100 g/min. At an antegrade cerebral perfusion rate of 50 mL/kg/min, cerebral blood flow matched baseline (P = .87), as did regional oxygen saturation (P = .13). Antegrade cerebral perfusion at 30 mL/kg/min provided approximately 60% of baseline cerebral blood flow (P < .002); however, regional oxygen saturation was equal to baseline (P = .93). Antegrade cerebral perfusion at 10 mL/kg/min provided 20% of baseline cerebral blood flow (P < .001) and a lower regional oxygen saturation than baseline (P = .011). Cerebral oxygen extraction at antegrade cerebral perfusion rates of 30 and 50 mL/kg/min was equal to baseline (P = .53, .48) but greater than baseline (P < .0001) at an antegrade cerebral perfusion rate of 10 mL/kg/min. The distributions of cerebral blood flow and regional oxygen saturation were equal in each brain hemisphere at all antegrade cerebral perfusion rates.Cerebral blood flow increased with antegrade cerebral perfusion rate. At an antegrade cerebral perfusion rate of 50 mL/kg/min, cerebral blood flow was equal to baseline, but regional oxygen saturation and cerebral oxygen extraction trends suggested more oxygenation than baseline. An antegrade cerebral perfusion rate of 30 mL/kg/min provided only 60% of baseline cerebral blood flow, but cerebral oxygen extraction and regional oxygen saturation were equal to baseline. An antegrade cerebral perfusion rate that closely matches standard cardiopulmonary bypass conditions is between 30 and 50 mL/kg/min.\nPulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is associated with significant perioperative risk for major complications in children, including pulmonary hypertensive crisis and cardiac arrest. Uncertainty remains about the safety of ketamine anesthesia in this patient population.Retrospectively review the medical records of children with PAH to ascertain the nature and frequency of peri-procedural complications and to determine whether ketamine administration was associated with peri-procedural complications.Children with PAH (mean pulmonary artery pressure > or =25 mmHg and pulmonary vascular resistance index > or =3 Wood units) who underwent general anesthesia for procedures during a 6-year period (2002-2008) were enrolled. Details about the patient, PAH, procedure, anesthetic and postprocedural course were noted, including adverse events during or within 48 h of the procedure. Complication rates were reported per procedure. Association between ketamine and peri-procedural complications was tested.Sixty-eight children (median age 7.3 year, median weight 22 kg) underwent 192 procedures. Severity of PAH was mild (23%), moderate (37%), and severe (40%). Procedures undertaken were major surgery (n = 20), minor surgery (n = 27), cardiac catheterization (n = 128) and nonsurgical procedures (n = 17). Ketamine was administered during 149 procedures. Twenty minor and nine major complications were noted. Incidence of cardiac arrest was 0.78% for cardiac catheterization procedures, 10% for major surgical procedures and 1.6% for all procedures. There was no procedure-related mortality. Ketamine administration was not associated with increased complications.Ketamine appears to be a safe anesthetic option for children with PAH. We report rates for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and mortality that are more favorable than those previously reported.\nNeurologic injury is a feared and serious long-term complication of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA). Postoperative hyperthermia was found to enhance postischemic neurologic injury. The use of core temperature as the reference point through CPB assumes parallel changes in brain temperature. We tested the hypothesis that regional and deep brain temperature (DBT) differ during cooling, DHCA, and rewarming.Neonatal piglets (n = 9) were subject to CPB and cooled to rectal temperature (RT) of 18 degrees C, 30 minutes of DHCA were initiated, and subsequently the piglets were rewarmed to RT of 36.5 degrees C and weaned from CPB. Temperature probes were inserted into the DBT targeting the caudate and thalamic nuclei, their position confirmed by pathology. Superficial brain temperature was measured by a temperature probe inserted extradurally. RT, nasopharyngeal (NPT), and tympanic (TT) temperatures were recorded.During cooling the deep brain cooled faster and to lower temperatures compared to RT and TT; NPT reflected DBT accurately. During rewarming DBT was significantly higher than RT and TT. By the end of rewarming the difference between the deep brain and the RT reached statistical significance (30 minutes: 35.1 +/- 0.7 vs. 32.3 +/- 0.7 p < 0.05, respectively, 40 minutes: 37.5 +/- 0.3 vs. 34.7 +/- 0.8 p < 0.05, respectively).Deep brain hyperthermia routinely occurs during the last stages of rewarming following DHCA. DBT is accurately reflected by NPT and is directly correlated with inflow temperature. Therefore, during rewarming inflow temperatures should not exceed 36 degrees C and NPT should be closely monitored.\nPluripotent cardiac progenitor cells resident in myocardium offer a potentially promising role in promoting recovery from injury. In pediatric congenital heart disease (CHD) patients, manipulation of resident progenitor cells may provide important new approaches to improving outcomes. Our study goals were to identify and quantitate populations of progenitor cells in human neonatal myocardium during the early postnatal period and determine the proliferative capacity of differentiated cardiac myocytes.Immunologic markers of cell lineage (stage-specific embryonic antigen 4 [SSEA-4], islet cell antigen 1 [Isl1], c-kit, Nkx2.5, sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium-regulated ATPase type 2 [SERCA2]) and proliferation (Ki67) were localized in right ventricular biopsies from 32 CHD patients aged 2 to 93 days.Neonatal myocardium contains progenitor cells and transitional cells expressing progenitor and differentiated myocyte marker proteins. Some cells expressed the pluripotent cell marker c-kit and also coexpressed the myocyte marker SERCA2. Multipotent progenitor cells, identified by the expression of Isl1, were found. Ki67 was expressed in some myocytes and in nonmyocyte cells. A few cells expressing SSEA-4 and Isl1 were observed during the early postnatal period. Cells expressing c-kit, the premyocyte marker Nkx2.5, and Ki67 were found throughout the first postnatal month. A progressive decline in cell density during the first postnatal month was observed for c-kit+ cells (p = 0.0013) and Nkx2.5+ cells (p = 0.0001). The percentage of cells expressing Ki67 declined during the first 3 postnatal months (p = 0.0030).Cells in an incomplete state of cardiomyocyte differentiation continue to reside in the infant heart. However, the relative density of progenitor cells declines during the first postnatal month.\nNeonates undergoing open-heart surgery are especially at risk for massive bleeding and pronounced inflammation. The efficacy of aprotinin, a serine protease inhibitor, at ameliorating these adverse effects of cardiopulmonary bypass has not been clearly demonstrated in neonates.Term neonates were enrolled and randomly assigned in a blinded fashion to receive saline (group P, placebo) or high-dose aprotinin (group A). Intraoperative management was standardized: surgeon, anesthesia, cardiopulmonary bypass and hemostasis therapy. Patients were admitted postoperatively to a pediatric cardiac intensive care unit. Primary outcome measure of efficacy was duration of the postoperative mechanical ventilation. Secondary outcome measures were total volume and units of blood products transfused intraoperatively and for 24 h after surgery, duration of chest tube in situ, and intensive care and hospital stays after surgery.Twenty-six neonates were enrolled; 13 received aprotinin and 13 received placebo. The study was halted prematurely because of US Food and Drug Administration's concerns about aprotinin's safety. Baseline patient, surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass characteristics were similar between groups. No outcome variables differed between groups (P > 0.05). Duration of postoperative ventilation was 115 +/- 139 h (group A); 126 +/- 82 h (group P); P = 0.29, and total blood product exposure was 8.2 +/- 2.6 U (group A); 8.8 +/- 1.4 U (group P); P = 0.1. Postoperative blood creatinine values did not differ between groups. In-hospital mortality rate was 4%.Aprotinin was not shown to be efficacious in neonates undergoing open-heart surgery. It is unclear whether adult aprotinin safety data are relevant to neonates undergoing open-heart surgery.\nThe use of ketamine in children with increased pulmonary vascular resistance is controversial. In this prospective, open label study, we evaluated the hemodynamic responses to ketamine in children with pulmonary hypertension (mean pulmonary artery pressure >25 mm Hg).Children aged 3 mo to 18 yr with pulmonary hypertension, who were scheduled for cardiac catheterization with general anesthesia, were studied. Patients were anesthetized with sevoflurane (1 minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration [MAC]) in air while breathing spontaneously via a facemask. After baseline catheterization measurements, sevoflurane was reduced (0.5 MAC) and ketamine (2 mg/kg IV over 5 min) was administered, followed by a ketamine infusion (10 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1)). Catheterization measurements were repeated at 5, 10, and 15 min after completion of ketamine load. Data at various time points were compared (ANOVA, P < 0.05).Fifteen patients (age 147, 108 mo; median, interquartile range) were studied. Diagnoses included idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (5), congenital heart disease (9), and diaphragmatic hernia (1). At baseline, median (interquartile range) baseline pulmonary vascular resistance index was 11.3 (8.2) Wood units; 33% of patients had suprasystemic mean pulmonary artery pressures. Heart rate (99, 94 bpm; P = 0.016) and Pao2 (95, 104 mm Hg; P = 007) changed after ketamine administration (baseline, 15 min after ketamine; P value). There were no significant differences in mean systemic arterial blood pressure, mean pulmonary artery pressure, systemic or pulmonary vascular resistance index, cardiac index, arterial pH, or Paco2.In the presence of sevoflurane, ketamine did not increase pulmonary vascular resistance in spontaneously breathing children with severe pulmonary hypertension.\nThis report describes a case of thoracoscopic repair of esophageal atresia with a rare type D tracheoesophageal fistula in a child with complex congenital heart disease. We demonstrate the feasibility of thoracoscopic repair and anesthetic management in a child with complex congenital heart disease.\nThe initial findings from the Pediatric Perioperative Cardiac Arrest (POCA) Registry (1994-1997) revealed that medication-related causes, often cardiovascular depression from halothane, were the most common. Changes in pediatric anesthesia practice may have altered the causes of cardiac arrest in anesthetized children.Nearly 80 North American institutions that provide anesthesia for children voluntarily enrolled in the Pediatric Perioperative Cardiac Arrest Registry. A standardized data form for each perioperative cardiac arrest in children < 0.05). Cardiovascular causes of cardiac arrest were the most common (41% of all arrests), with hypovolemia from blood loss and hyperkalemia from transfusion of stored blood the most common identifiable cardiovascular causes. Among respiratory causes of arrest (27%), airway obstruction from laryngospasm was the most common cause. Vascular injury incurred during placement of central venous catheters was the most common equipment-related cause of arrest. The cause of arrest varied by phase of anesthesia care (P < 0.01). Cardiovascular and respiratory causes occurred most commonly in the surgical and postsurgical phases, respectively.A reduction in the proportion of arrests related to cardiovascular depression due to halothane may be related to the declining use of halothane in pediatric anesthetic practice. The incidence of the most common remaining causes of arrest in each category may be reduced through preventive measures.\nChildren with cardiomyopathy (CM) often undergo procedures that require general anesthesia (GA) but little is known about anesthesia-related adverse events or postprocedural outcomes.After approval, all children with CM who underwent nonopen heart surgical procedures and/or diagnostic imaging under GA at a tertiary children's hospital during January 2002 to May 2005 were identified from a clinical database. Based on their preprocedure fractional shortening (FS) on echocardiogram, systemic ventricular dysfunction was categorized as mild (FS 23-28%), moderate (FS 16-22%), or severe (FS < 16%) and those with normal (FS > 28%) were excluded from review.Twenty-six patients underwent 34 procedures under GA, of whom 13 (38%) had mild or moderate ventricular dysfunction and 21 (62%) had severe dysfunction. Common procedures included pacer/defibrillator placement (43%) and imaging studies (18%). Eighteen complications were noted in 12 patients. Fifteen (83%) complications occurred in patients with severe ventricular dysfunction. One patient with severe ventricular dysfunction died (3% mortality). Hypotension requiring inotropic support was the most frequent complication (61%). Children with severe ventricular dysfunction often required hospital support pre- and postprocedure with 67% requiring intensive care. Hospital stay was longer for patients with severe ventricular dysfunction compared with children with mild or moderate ventricular dysfunction (P = 0.006).The 30-day mortality rate was low but complications were common, especially in patients with severe ventricular dysfunction. For these patients, we recommend early consideration of perioperative intensive care support to optimize cardiovascular therapy and monitoring.\nLaparoscopy has advanced the care of children for a variety of pediatric surgical diseases. However, complication rates for laparoscopic interventions in neonates with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) have not been well described. The purpose of this study is to present the largest reported series of laparoscopic surgery performed in patients with HLHS.We conducted a single-institution, retrospective chart review for all neonates with HLHS who underwent a laparoscopic procedure from September 2002 to March 2005. Data regarding patient characteristics, intraoperative monitoring, previous cardiac surgery, perioperative complications, and postoperative mortality were assessed.Twelve patients with HLHS underwent a total of 13 operations during the study period (8 combined Nissen fundoplication and gastrostomy tubes, 3 isolated gastrostomy tubes, 1 Ladd procedure, and 1 combined Nissen fundoplication and gastrocutaneous fistula closure). All cases were completed laparoscopically. Patients had undergone palliative cardiac surgery but were not completely corrected; therefore, they were cyanotic. Perioperative complications were observed in 6 patients (3 gastrostomy tube site infections, 1 small bowel obstruction, 1 postoperative sepsis, and 1 urinary tract infection). There was no mortality in this series.From this experience, it appears that laparoscopy can be performed safely and with satisfactory outcomes in patients with HLHS. However, a multidisciplinary approach, including the availability of a skilled and experienced cardiac anesthesia team, is believed to be critical to optimize outcomes in these critically ill children.\nWith advances in medical care, survival after cardiac surgery for congenital heart disease has dramatically improved, and attention is increasingly focused on long-term functional morbidities, especially neurodevelopmental outcomes, with their profound consequences to patients and society. There are multiple reasons for concern about brain injury. Some cardiac defects are associated with brain anomalies and altered cerebral blood flow regulation. Brain imaging studies have demonstrated that injury to gray and white matter is quite frequent before heart surgery in neonates. Cardiopulmonary bypass and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest are associated with short- and longer-term adverse neurologic outcome. Additional brain injury can occur during the patient's recovery from surgery. Strategies to optimize neurologic outcome continue to evolve. With new technological developments, perioperative neurologic monitoring of small children has become easier, and data suggest these modalities usefully identify adverse neurologic events and might predict outcome. Monitoring methods to be discussed include processed electroencephalography, near infrared spectroscopy, and transcranial Doppler ultrasound. Alternative perfusion techniques to deep hypothermic circulatory arrest have been developed, such as regional antegrade cerebral perfusion during cardiopulmonary bypass. Other neuroprotective strategies employed during open-heart surgery include temperature regulation, acid-base management, degree of hemodilution, blood glucose control and anti-inflammatory therapies. Evidence of the impact of these measures on neurologic outcome is examined, and deficiencies in our current understanding of neurologic function in children with congenital heart disease are identified.\nRegional low-flow perfusion has been used to minimize ischemic brain injury during complex heart surgery in children. However, optimal regional low-flow perfusion remains undetermined. Visible light spectroscopy is a reliable method for continuous determination of capillary oxygen saturation (SgvO2). We used visible light spectroscopy to follow deep and superficial brain SgvO2 during cardiopulmonary bypass, regional low-flow perfusion, and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest.Visible light spectroscopy probes were inserted into the superficial and deep brain of neonatal (3.9-4.5 kg) piglets, targeting the caudate and thalamic nuclei. The piglets were subjected to cardiopulmonary bypass and cooled to a rectal temperature of 18 degrees C using pH stat. Regional low-flow perfusion was initiated through the innominate artery at 18 degrees C, and pump flows were adjusted to 40, 30, 20, and 10 mL/kg/min for 10-minute intervals followed by 30 minutes of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. Regional low-flow perfusion was reestablished, and flows were increased in a stepwise manner from 10 to 40 mL/kg/min. SgvO2 was continuously monitored. Carotid flow was measured using a flow probe, and cerebral blood flow (milliliters per kilogram body weight per minute) was calculated.There were no significant differences between the deep and superficial brain tissue oxygenation during regional low flow brain perfusion before deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. However, after deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, the superficial brain SgvO2 was lower than the deep brain SgvO2 (24 +/- 12 vs 55.3 +/- 8, P = .05, at flows of 30 mL/kg/min, and 34.2 +/- 17 vs 62.5 + 8, P = .06, at a flow rate of 40 mL/kg/min). During regional low-flow perfusion, SgvO2 was maintained at flows of 30 to 40 mL/kg/min (cerebral blood flows of 15 to 21 mL/kg/min and 19 to 24 mL/kg/min, respectively), but was significantly lower at pump flows of 20 mL/kg/min (cerebral blood flow of 10 to 14 mL/kg/min) and 10 mL/kg/min (cerebral blood flow of 5 to 9 mL/kg/min) compared with the values obtained just before regional low-flow perfusion (pre-deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, 37 +/- 6 vs 65.5 +/- 4.4, P < .05, and 21.6 +/- 3.7 vs 65.5 +/- 4.4, P < .01, respectively; and post-deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, 32 +/- 4.5 vs 65.5 +/- 4.4, P < .05, and 16.6 +/- 4.7 vs 65.5 +/- 4.4, P < .01, respectively).Regional low-flow perfusion at pump flows of 30 to 40 mL/kg/min with resulting cerebral blood flows of 14 to 24 mL/kg/min was adequate in maintaining both deep and superficial brain oxygenation. However, lower pump flows of 20 and 10 mL/kg/min, associated with cerebral blood flow of 9 to 14 mL/kg/min, resulted in significantly reduced SgvO2 values.\nThis prospective study compared clinical outcomes after heart surgery between three groups of infants with congenital heart disease. One group received dilutional conventional ultrafiltration (group D), another received modified ultrafiltration (group M), and a third group received both dilutional conventional and modified ultrafiltration (group B). We hypothesized that group B patients would have the best clinical outcome.Children younger than 1 year undergoing heart surgery for biventricular repair by the same surgeon were randomly allocated to one of the three study groups. Patient management was standardized, and intensive care staff were blinded to group allocation. Primary outcome measure was duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation. Other outcome measures recorded included total blood products transfused, duration of chest tube in situ, chest tube output, and stays in intensive care and in the hospital.Sixty infants completed study protocol. Mean age and weight were as follows: group D (n = 19), 61 days, 4.3 kg; group M (n = 20), 64 days, 4.5 kg; and group B (n = 21), 86 days, 4.4 kg. Preoperative and intraoperative characteristics were similar between groups. Ultrafiltrate volumes obtained were 196 +/- 93 mL/kg in group D, 105 +/- 33 mL/kg in group M, and 261 +/- 113 mL/kg in group B. There were no significant differences between groups for any outcome variable. Technical difficulties prevented completion of modified ultrafiltration in 2 of 41 infants.There was no clinical advantage in combining conventional and modified ultrafiltration. Because clinical outcomes were similar across groups, relative risks of the ultrafiltration strategies may influence choice.\nDaily variability in volume of elective pediatric procedures that require anesthesia may lead to an imbalance between available operating room resources and case load. Longer intervals between scheduling and the surgical date generally result in higher operating room utilization. In this study, we sought to determine which factors influence when parents schedule their children for procedures. We also aimed to identify parents' ideal and longest acceptable waiting intervals and determine whether type of procedure, for example, affects scheduling. From a convenience sample of 250 randomly selected parents of children presenting for elective surgery, 236 completed surveys were analyzed. The remaining 14 surveys were not returned. Overall, parents scheduled their child's procedure a median of 4.3 wk (interquartile range 2.0-8.6) in advance and reported an ideal waiting interval of 3 wk (interquartile range 2-4), and longest acceptable interval of 6 wk (interquartile range 4-10). Parents were willing to wait longer to schedule cardiac (4 wk, P = 0.004) and plastic (3.5 wk, P = 0.024) surgery when compared with general surgical procedures. Overall, parents ranked severity of the child's illness, earliest available time, and surgeon's suggested date as the three most important factors influencing when their child's surgery is scheduled. The timetable for scheduling procedures was highly correlated with both mother and father having available time off work (tau(b) = 0.72, P < 0.0001). Surprisingly, parents did not show a preference for scheduling cases during vacation or summer months.\nVisible light spectroscopy (VLS) is newer technology that measures real-time tissue oxygenation. It has been validated in detecting mucosal ischemia in adults. During complex neonatal heart surgery, antegrade cerebral perfusion (ACP) maintains cerebral saturation. Whether ACP maintains peripheral tissue perfusion in humans is not known.Five patients undergoing neonatal open heart surgery with hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) were studied using a VLS esophageal probe in addition to bilateral near infrared cerebral oximetry. Three of five patients required ACP for arch repair, while two patients did not. VLS and cerebral saturation data were collected and analyzed in 5 min intervals prior to CPB, during CPB, and during ACP.In the two patients undergoing heart surgery with routine hypothermic CPB, both cerebral and esophageal saturations were maintained. However in all three neonates requiring ACP, although cerebral saturations did not decrease, esophageal saturation fell below the ischemic threshold (35%). Following establishment of normal CPB, esophageal saturation returned to baseline.Antegrade cerebral perfusion maintains cerebral oxygen delivery, however, it does not adequately perfuse the esophagus in neonates. This could have clinical implications.\nNeonates with congenital heart disease might require surgical repair with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, a technique associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. Antegrade cerebral perfusion is thought to minimize ischemic brain injury, although there are no supporting experimental data. We sought to evaluate and compare the extent of neurologic injury in a neonatal piglet model of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest and antegrade cerebral perfusion.Neonatal piglets undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass were randomized to deep hypothermic circulatory arrest or antegrade cerebral perfusion for 45 minutes. Animals were killed after 6 hours of recovery, and brain tissue was stained for evidence of cellular injury and for the apoptotic markers activated caspase 3 and cytochrome c translocation from mitochondria to cytosol.Piglets from the antegrade cerebral perfusion group exhibited less apoptotic or necrotic injury (4 +/- 3 vs 29 +/- 12 cells per field, P = .03). The piglets undergoing antegrade cerebral perfusion also had less evidence of apoptosis, with fewer cells staining for activated caspase 3 (57 +/- 8 vs 93 +/- 9 cells per field, P = .001) or showing cytochrome c translocation (6 +/- 2 vs 15 +/- 4 cells per field, P = .02).The use of antegrade cerebral perfusion in place of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest reduces evidence of apoptosis and histologic injury in neonatal piglets. Neonates with congenital heart disease might benefit from antegrade cerebral perfusion during complex cardiac surgery to improve their overall neurologic outcome.\nTo observe the effects of right carotid artery ligation and variations in extracorporeal life support (ECLS) flow on regional cerebral oxygenation index (rSO2i) measured using near infrared spectroscopy.Prospective observational study.Tertiary children's hospital.Eleven neonatal and pediatric patients requiring veno-arterial ECLS support between June 2000 and March 2003.Near infrared spectroscopy probe placement on left and right frontal regions of patients undergoing ECLS, before vessel cannulation or within 24 hrs of initiation of ECLS.Regional cerebral oxygenation was measured every minute for 72 hrs or until the patient was decannulated. The effect of cannulation on rSO2i from each hemisphere of the brain and the relationship between ECLS flow and rSO2i during ECLS support and \"trialing off\" periods were determined. Ligation of the right carotid artery resulted in a 12-25% decrease in rSO2i from baseline in the right frontal region for a duration ranging from 17 to 45 mins before returning toward baseline. No substantial change in the left frontal region rSO2i was detected during cannulation. Following this depression in rSO2i on the right, there was a transient increase above baseline in rSO2i observed in both hemispheres on initiating ECLS. No correlation between ECLS flow and rSO2i was found over the 72-hr period. Periods of \"trialing off\" ECLS were not related to any change in rSO2i in either hemisphere.This study demonstrated no relationship between ECLS flow and rSO2i changes during the 72-hr observation period. A brief period of cerebral oxygen desaturation of the right frontal region at the time of right carotid ligation was seen in all three study patients examined during cannulation, followed by an increased rSO2i with initiation of ECLS flow. Near infrared spectroscopy measurement may offer an important adjunct for neurologic monitoring of ECLS patients.\nAnesthesia considerations for pediatric thoracic solid organ transplant. Anesthesiology clinics of North America Williams, G. D., Ramamoorthy, C. 2005; 23 (4): 709-?\nThis article discusses the indications, perioperative management, postoperative complications, and patient outcome of pediatric heart transplantation and pediatric lung transplantation. Special emphasis is placed on the anesthetic considerations relevant for children who are undergoing or have received a solid thoracic organ transplant.\nDeep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) has been used for the past 50 years in the surgical repair of complex congenital cardiac malformations and operations involving the aortic arch; it enables the surgeon to achieve precise anatomical reconstructions by creating a bloodless operative field. Nevertheless, DHCA has been associated with immediate and late neurodevelopmental morbidities. This review provides an overview of the pathophysiology of neonatal hypoxic brain injury after DHCA, focusing on cellular mechanisms of necrosis, apoptosis, and glutamate excitotoxicity. Techniques and strategies in neonatal brain protection include hypothermia, acid base blood gas management during cooling, and pharmacologic interventions such as the use of volatile anesthetics. Surgical techniques consist of intermittent cerebral perfusion during periods of circulatory arrest and continuous regional brain perfusion.\nEstimating appropriate tracheal tube (TT) depth following tracheal intubation in infants and children presents a challenge to anesthesia practitioners. We evaluated three methods commonly used by anesthesiologists to determine which one most reliably results in appropriate positioning.After IRB approval, 60 infants and children scheduled for fluoroscopic procedures requiring general anesthesia were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (1) deliberate mainstem intubation with subsequent withdrawal of the TT 2 cm above the carina ('mainstem' method); (2) alignment of the double black line marker near the TT tip at the vocal cords ('marker' method); or (3) placement of the TT at a depth determined by the formula: TT depth (cm) = 3 x TT size (mmID) ('formula' method). TT tip position was determined to be 'appropriate' if located between the sternoclavicular junction (SCJ) and 0.5 cm above the carina as determined by fluoroscopy. Risk ratios were calculated, and data were analysed by the chi-square test accepting statistical significance at P < 0.05.The mainstem method was associated with the highest rate of appropriate TT placement (73%) compared with both the marker method (53%, P = 0.03, RR = 1.56) and the formula method (42%, P = 0.006, RR = 2.016). There was no difference between the marker and formula methods overall (P = 0.2, RR = 1.27). Analysis of age-stratified data demonstrated higher success with the marker method compared with the formula method for patients 3-12 months (P = 0.0056, RR = 4.0).Deliberate mainstem intubation most reliably results in appropriate TT depth in infants and children.\nA neonate with VACTERL association including tricuspid atresia was scheduled for thoracoscopic esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula (EA/TEF) repair and laparoscopic gastrostomy tube placement. In addition to standard noninvasive monitoring, arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure, and cerebral oxygen saturation were monitored. Gastric distension resulting from positive pressure ventilation prevented laparoscopic gastrostomy tube placement. Thoracoscopy with a CO2 insufflation pressure of 6 mm Hg at low flow (1 L/min) was well tolerated hemodynamically despite hypercarbia and cerebral oxygen saturation was maintained. Careful monitoring and good communication were critical to the safe management of this single ventricle patient during thoracoscopic EA/TEF repair.Esophageal and tracheoesophageal fistula in conjunction with single ventricle physiology carries a significant risk of mortality. We present the anesthetic management of a neonate with unpalliated tricuspid atresia who underwent thoracoscopic tracheoesophageal fistula repair.\nThe safety of laparoscopic surgery in infants with single ventricle physiology has been a subject of controversy despite potential benefits over open surgery. We present the anesthetic management of five infants with palliated hypoplastic left heart syndrome that underwent laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. After anesthetic induction and tracheal intubation, an intraarterial catheter was placed for hemodynamic monitoring. Insufflation pressure was limited to 12 mm Hg and was well tolerated by all patients. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. In patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication can be safely performed with careful patient selection and close intraoperative monitoring.\nFetal cardiac surgery has potential benefits for treatment of some congenital heart defects. However, placental dysfunction as a result of fetal bypass, fetal stress, and fetal exposure to external milieu needs to be overcome to optimize the outcomes of fetal cardiac bypass. In this study we evaluated the technical feasibility of cardiac bypass in the nonhuman primate fetus and the efficacy of different anesthetic approaches.Twelve baboon fetuses, average gestation 146 +/- 8 days and weight 696 +/- 184 g, were used. Three fetuses were excluded from the study because of nuchal cord presentations. The animals were separated into two anesthesia groups: isoflurane (n = 6) and fentanyl and midazolam (n = 3). A miniature roller pump circuit without oxygenator was used for fetal bypass for 30 minutes. No blood transfusion was performed. Fetal blood gas samples were collected before bypass, during bypass, and at 15 and 60 minutes after bypass.All fetuses in the isoflurane group were successfully placed on the cardiac bypass circuit. However, 2 animals in the fentanyl and midazolam group were not placed on the bypass circuit because of sustained elevation in maternal uterine tone. All maternal baboons survived. Of the 6 fetuses in the isoflurane group, 5 survived for 60 minutes; however, placental function continued to deteriorate after bypass (Pa o 2 33 +/- 3 mm Hg before bypass, 23 +/- 6 mm Hg 15 minutes after, and 18 +/- 9 mm Hg 60 minutes after).The technical feasibility of cardiac bypass in nonhuman primate fetuses weighing less than 1000 g was confirmed. Isoflurane anesthesia appears to be superior to fentanyl and midazolam anesthesia for fetal cardiac surgery because of adequate uterine relaxation.\nThe incidence of neurological complications after pediatric cardiac surgery ranges from 2% to 25%. The causes are multifactorial and include preoperative brain malformations, perioperative hypoxemia and low cardiac output states, sequelae of cardiopulmonary bypass, and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. Neurological monitoring devices are readily available and the anesthesiologist can now monitor the brain during pediatric cardiac surgery. In this review we discuss near-infrared cerebral oximetry, transcranial Doppler ultrasound, and electroencephalographic monitors for use during congenital heart surgery. After review of the basic principles of each monitoring modality, we discuss their uses during pediatric heart surgery. We present evidence that multimodal neurological monitoring in conjunction with a treatment algorithm may improve neurological outcome for patients undergoing congenital heart surgery and present one such algorithm.\nDeep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA), as used in infant heart surgery, carries a risk of brain injury. In a piglet DHCA model, neocortical neurons appear to undergo apoptotic death. Caspases, cytochrome c, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and Fas play a role in apoptosis in many ischemic models. This study examined the expression of these factors in a DHCA piglet model.Thirty-nine anesthetized piglets were studied. After cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) cooling of the brain temperature to 19 degrees C, DHCA was induced for 90 min, followed by CPB rewarming. After separation from CPB, piglets were killed at 1, 4, 8, 24, and 72 h and 1 week. Caspase-8 and -3 activity, and concentrations of TNF-alpha, Fas, Fas-ligand, cytochrome c, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) were measured in the neocortex by enzymatic assay and Western blot analysis. Caspase-8 and -3 activity and cell death were examined histologically. Significance was set at P < 0.05.In neocortex, damaged neurons were not observed in control (no CPB), rarely observed in CPB (no DHCA), and rarely observed in the DHCA 1-h, 4-h, and 1-week reperfusion groups. However, they were seen frequently in the DHCA 8-, 24-, and 72-h reperfusion groups. Although neuronal death was widespread 8-72 h after DHCA, cortical ATP concentrations remained unchanged from control. Both caspase-3 and -8 activities were significantly increased at 8 h after DHCA, and caspase-3 concentration remained elevated for as long as 72 h. Caspase-3 and -8 activity was also observed in damaged neocortical neurons. Cytosolic cytochrome c and Fas were significantly expressed at 1 h and 4 h after DHCA, respectively. Fas-ligand and TNF-alpha were not observed in any group.After DHCA, induction of apoptosis in the neocortex occurs within a few hours of reperfusion and continues for several days. Increased Fas, cytochrome c, and caspase concentrations, coupled with normal brain ATP concentrations and apoptotic histologic appearance, are consistent with the occurrence of apoptotic cell death.\nRelatively rare adverse events, such as unexpected cardiac arrest, are difficult to study in the clinical setting. These events are often unpredictable in their occurrence (prompting interest in their investigation) and do not occur with sufficient frequency in any single institution to provide an adequate sample for analysis. A disease-specific registry is an epidemiological technique that can be used to collect data on a set of relatively rare unpredictable events. This approach was adopted for investigation of cardiac arrest in children when it became apparent from analysis of malpractice claims that a significant clinical problem existed. This report provides a brief historical account of the development of the Pediatric Peri-Operative Cardiac Arrest (POCA) Registry and elaborates on the methodology including strengths, weaknesses, and practical implementation issues.\nNeonates with functional single ventricle often require hypoxic or hypercapnic inspired gas mixtures to reduce pulmonary overcirculation and improve systemic perfusion. Although the impact of these treatments on arterial oxygen saturation has been described, the effects on cerebral oxygenation remain uncertain. This study examined the effect of these treatments on cerebral oxygen saturation and systemic hemodynamics.Neonates with single ventricle mechanically ventilated with room air were enrolled in a randomized crossover trial of 17% inspired oxygen or 3% inspired carbon dioxide. Each treatment lasted 10 min, followed by a 10-20-min washout period. Cerebral and arterial oxygen saturation were measured by cerebral and pulse oximetry, respectively. Cerebral oxygen saturation, arterial oxygen saturation, and other physiologic data were continuously recorded.Three percent inspired carbon dioxide increased cerebral oxygen saturation (56 +/- 13 to 68 +/- 13%; P < 0.01), whereas 17% inspired oxygen had no effect (53 +/- 13 to 53 +/- 14%; P = 0.8). Three percent inspired carbon dioxide increased the mean arterial pressure (45 +/- 8 to 50 +/- 9 mmHg; P < 0.01), whereas 17% inspired oxygen had no effect. And 3% inspired carbon dioxide decreased arterial pH and increased arterial carbon dioxide and oxygen tensions.Inspired 3% carbon dioxide improved cerebral oxygenation and mean arterial pressure. Treatment with 17% inspired oxygen had no effect on either.\nSeveral techniques have been suggested to reduce the trauma of nasotracheal intubation, although no comparative studies exist. The authors evaluated red-rubber catheters as a guide to nasotracheal intubation.Children presenting for elective surgery were randomized to undergo red-rubber catheter-guided nasotracheal intubation or to have the nasotracheal tube alone inserted. After general anesthesia and paralysis with vecuronium, the nares were prepared with topical vasoconstrictor. The nasotracheal tube was softened with warm water. In the catheter-guided group, the nasotracheal tube tip was fitted to the trailing end of the red-rubber catheter, and the two were advanced together. The red-rubber catheter was retrieved from the nasopharynx, disconnected, and removed. In the other group, the nasotracheal tube was advanced blindly into the nasopharynx. In both groups, intubation was then completed during direct laryngoscopy using Magill forceps. A blinded observer swabbed the pharynx and rated the severity of bleeding based on reference photographs.Age, weight, snoring history, and difficulty of intubation were not different between groups. Obvious bleeding was lower using the red-rubber catheter technique (10 vs. 29%, P = 0.013), which took longer to perform (74 vs. 56 s, P = 0.02).Although the incidence of bleeding in both groups was similar, severity of bleeding was reduced in the catheter-guided group during nasotracheal intubation. Use of a red-rubber catheter may reduce the trauma associated with nasotracheal intubation.\nManagement strategies for preoperative infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) include increased inspired nitrogen (hypoxia) and increased inspired carbon dioxide (hypercarbia). There are no studies directly comparing these 2 therapies in humans. This study compares the impact of hypoxia versus hypercarbia on oxygen delivery, under conditions of fixed minute ventilation.Ten anesthetized and paralyzed preoperative infants with HLHS were evaluated in a prospective, randomized, crossover trial comparing hypoxia (17% FIO(2)) with hypercarbia (2.7% FICO(2)). Each patient was treated in a random order (10 minutes per condition) with a recovery period (15 to 20 minutes) in room air. Arterial (SaO(2)) and superior vena caval (SvO(2)) co-oximetry and cerebral oxygen saturation (ScO(2)) measurements were made at the end of each condition and recovery period. ScO(2) was measured by near infrared spectroscopy. Hypoxia significantly decreased both SaO(2) (-5.2+/-1.1%, P=0.0014) and SvO(2) (-5.6+/-1.7%, P=0.009) compared with baseline, but arteriovenous oxygen saturation (AVO(2)) difference (SaO(2)-SvO(2)) and ScO(2) remained unchanged. Hypercarbia decreased SaO(2) (-2.6+/-0.6%, P=0.002) compared with baseline but increased both ScO(2) (9.6+/-1.8%, P=0.0001) and SvO(2) (6+/-2.2%, P=0.022) and narrowed the AVO(2) difference (-8.5+/-2.3%, P=0.005). Both hypoxia and hypercarbia decreased the balance between pulmonary and systemic blood flow (Qp:Qs) compared with baseline.In preoperative infants with HLHS, under conditions of anesthesia and paralysis, although Qp:Qs falls in both conditions, oxygen delivery is unchanged during hypoxia and increased during hypercarbia. These data cannot differentiate cerebral from systemic oxygen delivery.\nThe Pediatric Perioperative Cardiac Arrest (POCA) Registry was formed in 1994 in an attempt to determine the clinical factors and outcomes associated with cardiac arrest in anesthetized children.Institutions that provide anesthesia for children are voluntarily enrolled in the POCA Registry. A representative from each institution provides annual institutional demographic information and submits anonymously a standardized data form for each cardiac arrest (defined as the need for chest compressions or as death) in anesthetized children 18 yr of age or younger. Causes and factors associated with cardiac arrest are analyzed.In the first 4 yr of the POCA Registry, 63 institutions enrolled and submitted 289 cases of cardiac arrest. Of these, 150 arrests were judged to be related to anesthesia. Cardiac arrest related to anesthesia had an incidence of 1.4 +/- 0.45 (mean +/- SD) per 10,000 instances of anesthesia and a mortality rate of 26%. Medication-related (37%) and cardiovascular (32%) causes of cardiac arrest were most common, together accounting for 69% of all arrests. Cardiovascular depression from halothane, alone or in combination with other drugs, was responsible for two thirds of all medication-related arrests. Thirty-three percent of the patients were American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 1-2; in this group, 64% of arrests were medication-related, compared with 23% in American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 3-5 patients (P < 0.01). Infants younger than 1 yr of age accounted for 55% of all anesthesia-related arrests. Multivariate analysis demonstrated two predictors of mortality: American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 3-5 (odds ratio, 12.99; 95% confidence interval, 2.9-57.7), and emergency status (odds ratio, 3. 88; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-9.6).Anesthesia-related cardiac arrest occurred most often in patients younger than 1 yr of age and in patients with severe underlying disease. Patients in the latter group, as well as patients having emergency surgery, were most likely to have a fatal outcome. The identification of medication-related problems as the most frequent cause of anesthesia-related cardiac arrest has important implications for preventive strategies.\nWe sought to examine the effects of modified venovenous ultrafiltration after cardiopulmonary bypass on pulmonary compliance in infants.We prospectively enrolled 38 infants undergoing their first operation for congenital heart disease. Infants were randomized to receive 20 minutes of modified ultrafiltration after bypass or control. Static and dynamic compliance was measured after induction of anesthesia, before and immediately after filtration in the operating theater, 1 hour after return to the pediatric intensive care unit, and 24 hours after the operation. Length of time on the ventilator, inotropic requirements, and length of stay in the intensive care unit were recorded.Modified ultrafiltration produced a significant immediate improvement in dynamic (pre-ultrafiltration 2.5 +/- 1.9 mL/cm H(2)O to post-ultrafiltration 2.9 +/- 2.7 mL/cm H(2)O, P =.03) and static (pre-ultrafiltration 2.1 +/- 0.9 mL/cm H(2)O to post-ultrafiltration 2.9 +/- 2.1 mL/cm H(2)O, P =.04) compliance. However, there was no significant difference in the change in dynamic (P =.3) or static (P =.7) compliance in the ultrafiltration and control groups when compared before the operation, after the operation, and at 24 hours. There was no significant difference in the time to extubation between patients and control subjects (140 +/- 91 hours vs 90 +/- 58 hours) or the length of intensive care unit stay (10.0 +/- 9.1 days vs 7.4 +/- 5.7 days).Modified ultrafiltration produces an improvement in pulmonary compliance after bypass in infants. However, these improvements are not sustained past the immediate post-ultrafiltration period and do not lead to a decreased length of intubation or intensive care unit stay.\nTo examine whether coagulation tests, sampled before and during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), are related to blood loss and blood product transfusion requirements, and to determine what test value(s) provide the best sensitivity and specificity for prediction of excessive hemorrhage.Prospective.University-affiliated, pediatric medical center.Four hundred ninety-four children.Coagulation tests.Demographic, coagulation test, blood loss, and transfusion data were noted in consecutive children undergoing cardiac surgery. Laboratory tests included hematocrit (Hct), prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time (PTT), platelet count, fibrinogen concentration, and thromboelastography. Stepwise linear regression analysis indicated that platelet count during CPB was the variable most significantly associated with intraoperative blood loss (in milliliters per kilogram) and 12-hour chest tube output (in milliliters per kilogram). Other independent variables associated with blood loss were thromboelastography maximum amplitude (MA) during CPB, preoperative PTT, preoperative Hct, and preoperative thromboelastography angle and shear modulus values. Thromboelastography MA during CPB was the only variable associated with total products transfused (in milliliters per kilogram). Of all tests studied, platelet count during CPB (< or = 108,000/microL) provided the maximum sensitivity (83%) and specificity (58%) for prediction of excessive blood loss (receiver operating characteristic analysis). Blood loss was inversely related to patient age; neonates received the most donor units (median, 8 units; range, 6 to 10 units).During cardiac surgery, coagulation tests (including thromboelastography) drawn pre-CPB and during CPB are useful to identify children at risk for excessive bleeding. Platelet count during CPB was the variable most significantly associated with blood loss.\nIn this prospective cohort study of 548 children undergoing open-heart surgery, we evaluated demographic and perioperative factors to identify variables associated with perioperative blood loss and blood product transfusions. Using multivariate analysis, younger patient age was found to be the variable most significantly associated with bleeding and transfusions. Higher preoperative hematocrit, complex surgery, lower platelet count during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), and longer duration of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest were also significantly associated with bleeding and transfusion. Excessive postoperative chest tube (CT) drainage was associated with intraoperative bleeding. Independently associated variables accounted for 76% of the variability in CT output measured after 2 h in intensive care. Patients were subdivided into children aged < or =1 yr (infants) and children >1 yr; infants bled more intraoperatively (P<0.005); had greater cumulative CT output at 2, 6, 12, and 24 h (P<0.0001); and received more blood products (P<0.0001). Factors associated with bleeding and transfusions varied with patient age. Lower body core temperature during CPB was highly associated with blood loss and transfusions in infants, whereas resternotomy, preoperative congestive heart failure, and prolonged duration of CPB were significant factors associated with bleeding and transfusions in children >1 yr old.Knowledge of the factors associated with blood loss and blood product transfusions can help to identify children at risk of excessive bleeding after open-heart surgery.\nTo compare coagulation test results, blood loss, and blood product transfusions between patients receiving prophylactic epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) and a control group matched for age, resternotomy, and surgery in children undergoing cardiac surgery.Nested case-control study.University-affiliated, pediatric medical center.Same study period; 70 patients in EACA group and 70 patients in control group.Prophylactic EACA administered intravenously (load, 150 mg/kg, infusion; 30 mg/kg/h) to 70 patients at increased risk for bleeding (reoperation or Ross procedure).Coagulation test values were measured before, during, and after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Intraoperative blood loss, postoperative chest tube output, and allogenic blood product transfusions were recorded. Comparison of demographic and surgical data indicated close matching of the EACA and control groups. The EACA group ([median, 25th to 75th quartile] 15.6 mL/kg; 9.2 to 26.3 mL/kg) had less intraoperative blood loss than the control group (22.2 mL/kg; 14.3 to 36.3 mL/kg; p = 0.02). Postoperative chest tube output at 6 hours (p = 0.08), 12 hours (p = 0.07), and 24 hours (p = 0.08) was not significantly different between groups. Fewer EACA group patients required reexploration for bleeding (p < 0.05). There was no difference between groups in blood products transfused (in milliliters per kilogram or allogenic exposure per patient). Thromboelastography values (maximum amplitude [MA], whole blood clot lysis index at 30 minutes after MA) during CPB were better preserved in the EACA group.EACA reduced intraoperative blood loss but did not significantly decrease blood product transfusions. Lack of efficacy may be related to relative underdosing and should be further studied.\nThromboelastographic evaluation of the influence of fibrinolysis on blood loss and blood product transfusions in children during cardiac surgery.Prospective study.University-affiliated, pediatric medical center.Two hundred seventy-eight consecutive children undergoing cardiac surgery.Blood sampling for coagulation tests, including native and protamine-modified thromboelastography.Blood coagulation tests were measured before, during, and after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Demographic data, perioperative blood loss, and blood product transfusions were prospectively recorded. Fibrinolysis was defined as thromboelastography of A30/MA less than 0.85 (MA, maximum amplitude; A30, amplitude 30 minutes after MA) and was noted in 3% of children pre-CPB, 16% during CPB, and 3% post-CPB. Fibrinolysis before CPB was associated with poor cardiac output. Fibrinolysis during CPB occurred in young children (aged 350 +/- 836 days) undergoing complex surgery with prolonged CPB (119 +/- 48.8 minutes) and deep hypothermia (25.6 degrees C +/- 4.7 degrees C). These patients received blood products after CPB and were not fibrinolytic after transfusion. They incurred similar blood loss (in mL/kg) and received similar volumes of blood products (mL/kg) as age-matched and surgery-matched patients without fibrinolysis.A group of children at risk for fibrinolysis during CPB was identified. However, fibrinolysis during CPB did not influence blood loss or the total volume of blood products transfused.\nTo determine if vein localization with an audio Doppler increases successful central venous cannulation and decreases complications in infants and children when performed by inexperienced operators, compared with vein localization by anatomic landmarks (ALs).A prospective cohort of infants and children undergoing central venous cannulation for cardiac surgery.A university-affiliated children's hospital with a pediatric anesthesia fellowship program.All infants and children undergoing cardiac surgery between July 1, 1996, and January 1, 1997.Subjects had central venous catheters (CVCs) placed by an anesthesia fellow by either ALs or audio-Doppler localization of the veins.Eighty-four children were studied. Internal jugular vein (IJV) cannulation was attempted in 71 (85%) children and femoral vein cannulation in 13 (15%) children. Time to catheter insertion, number of needle passes, and artery puncture were noted. Sixty-one of 63 (97%) children had successful central venous cannulation by an anesthesia fellow using audio-Doppler vein localization. This was significantly greater than the 13 of 21 (62%) successful cannulations among children who had veins localized by ALs. Time to insertion did not differ by method of vein localization; however, the number of needle passes was significantly greater in the AL group. Artery puncture did not differ significantly by method of vein localization.Vein localization by audio Doppler significantly increases the rate of successful central venous cannulation and decreases the number of needle passes in pediatric patients when used by inexperienced operators.\nAlthough recent studies indicated young children are at risk for increased perioperative hemorrhage after open heart operations, the associations between patient age, blood loss and blood product transfusions have not been fully defined in children.Perioperative blood loss and blood product transfusion data were recorded for 414 consecutive children undergoing open heart procedures. The children were in the following age groups: 1 month or younger, group 1; older than 1 month to 12 months, group 2; older than 1 year to 5 years, group 3; and older than 5 years, group 4.Postoperative blood loss and blood product transfusions were inversely related to age and differed significantly between the four age groups. Multiple preoperative and intraoperative factors that possibly influence hemostasis also differed significantly between age groups. Median units transfused within 72 hours differed significantly with age (p < 0.0001): group 1, 8 units (range, 1 to 19 units); group 2, 6 units (range, 0 to 21 units); group 3, 2 units (range, 0 to 23 units); and group 4, 0 units (range, 0 to 38 units).Blood loss and transfusions vary inversely with age. Per kilogram of body weight, neonates bled more and received more donor products than any other age group.\nPeripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs) are commonly used intravenous access devices in children. Although PICCs are intended to be placed in central veins, many fail to reach this location. These noncentral PICCs are used for administration of medications and isotonic solutions.To examine the efficacy of noncentral PICCs for completion of therapy, the complications associated with their use, and the effectiveness of noncentral PICCs as compared with PICCs placed in a central vein.A prospective cohort study of children in whom PICCs were inserted, from January 1, 1994, to January 1, 1996.A university-affiliated teaching institution.Completion of intravenous therapy.A total of 587 PICCs were studied. Thirty-nine percent of PICCs were placed in noncentral veins. Centrally placed PICCs had significantly longer catheter duration compared with those placed noncentrally (16.6 vs 11.4 days, respectively). However, central and noncentral PICCs had similar therapy completion rates (73% and 69%, respectively). Catheter failure because of occlusion and accidental dislodgment were similar for central and noncentral PICCs. Likewise, complications caused by exit-site infection, phlebitis, and catheter-associated sepsis were also similar for catheters in the 2 locations. Catheter survival curves were similar for central and noncentral PICCs.Our study demonstrates that PICCs placed in noncentral veins provide reliable and safe intravenous access for administration of many medications and isotonic solutions for about 2 weeks' duration. The placement of PICCs in central veins may be restricted to those children who need central vascular access because of the type of intended therapy.\nThis prospective cohort study determined the incidence and risk factors for development of postdural puncture headache (PDPH) in children after lumbar puncture (LP). Eighty-six children were enrolled. LPs were performed with use of 22-gauge spinal needles with the bevel oriented parallel to the long axis of the spine. Follow-up telephone interviews and patients' diary of symptoms were collected. Headache brought on by sitting up and relieved by lying down was defined as PDPH. Of the 80 who completed the study, six (8%) developed PDPH. Two (3%) were less than 6 years old and four (5%) were 6 to 12 years of age. Children with a history of headache following a previous LP were nine times as likely to experience PDPH. PDPH occurs not infrequently in children. A prior history of headache is a predisposing factor.\nInjury associated with ischemia and reperfusion is a significant factor in a number of clinical diseases. We have completed a number of preclinical studies investigating the blockade of leukocyte adhesion molecules in ischemia-reperfusion injury. In our work and in the work of other investigators, monoclonal antibodies directed to CD18, P-selectin and L-selectin were effective in reducing ischemia-reperfusion injury to the rabbit ear and in reducing injury following hemorrhagic shock in both rabbits and nonhuman primates. Ischemia-reperfusion injury was also reduced by synthetic oligosaccharide sLe(x). These studies suggest that adhesion blockade might be effective in the clinical setting.\nWe investigated the pharmacokinetics and side effects of milrinone in infants and children (< or = 13 yr) after open heart surgery in this prospective, open-label study. Milrinone binding to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuitry was also examined in out two groups. Children in the small dose group (n = 11) received two 25-microg/kg boluses with a final infusion rate of 0.5 microg kg(-1) x min(-1); those in the large dose group (n = 8) received a 50-microg/kg bolus and a 25-microg/kg bolus with a final infusion rate of 0.75 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1). Blood samples for milrinone concentration were drawn 30 min after each bolus, at steady state, and after discontinuing the milrinone infusion. Pharmacokinetics were evaluated using traditional and nonlinear mixed effects modeling analysis. Milrinone kinetics best fit a two-compartment model. Steady-state plasma levels in the small and large dose groups were within the adult therapeutic range (113 +/- 39 and 206 +/- 74 ng/mL, respectively). The volumes of distribution (Vbeta) in infants (0.9 L/kg) and children (0.7 L/kg) were not different, but infants had significantly lower milrinone clearance (3.8 vs 5.9 mL x kg(-1) x min(-1)). Thrombocytopenia (defined as platelet count < or = 100,000 mm(-3)) occurred in 58%, and the risk increased significantly with duration of infusion. Tachyarrythmias were noted in two patients. Milrinone did not bind to CPB circuitry. We conclude that milrinone is cleared more rapidly in children than in adults. The major complication was thrombocytopenia. Implications: Most pediatric dosing is based on data published for adults. Infants and children have kinetics that differ from adults. We studied the distribution of I.V. milrinone in infants and children after open heart surgery. Milrinone had a larger volume of distribution and a faster clearance in infants and children than in adults, and dosing should be adjusted accordingly.\nTo determine the effects of red cell separation and ultrafiltration on heparin concentration.Prospective study.University-affiliated, pediatric medical center.Thirty-one children undergoing cardiac surgery.Blood sampled for heparin concentration and coagulation tests.Thirteen infants under-went modified veno-venous ultrafiltration (UF) after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). In addition, residual blood in the CPB circuit was hemoconcentrated by UF and reinfused (UF group). Heparin concentration increased from 2.0 +/- 0.6 to 2.5 +/- 0.8 U/mL, following modified UF; while activated coagulation time (ACT) decreased from 701 +/- 177 to 627 +/- 107 seconds. Heparin concentration of CPB circuit residual increased from 1.9 +/- 0.7 to 3.1 +/- 1.0 U/mL. In 18 children (older than 1 year old), the residual blood in the CPB circuit was hemoconcentrated by cell separation (CS) and reinfused (CS group). Heparin concentration of CPB circuit residual decreased from 2.6 +/- 0.6 to 0.3 +/- 0.2 U/mL. After reinfusion, patient heparin concentration remained unchanged at < 0.05 U/mL. Thrombin time increased from 28 +/- 6 to 48 +/- 29 seconds and did not correlate with H.The plasma concentration of heparin increased after veno-venous modified UF of the patient. Heparin concentration also increased after UF of residual CPB circuit blood. In contrast, circuit blood hemoconcentrated by CS contained minimal heparin, and, when infused, did not increase patient's heparin concentration. ACT and thrombin time did not correlate with heparin concentration.\nLeukocyte emigration in the lung occurs by both CD18-dependent and -independent mechanisms that are stimulus specific. We examined the effect of CD18 blockade (mAb 60.3) on neutrophil (PMN) emigration into, and bacterial clearance from, the lung. After intravenous treatment with either mAb 60.3 or saline, rabbits were given an intralobar inoculation with 10(9) colony-forming units of either Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli. Four hours after inoculation, lungs were lavaged to assess PMN emigration. CD18 blockade reduced PMN emigration to E. coli by 76% but only 45% to S. aureus. Experiments to determine bacterial recovery from the lungs at 4, 8, and 24 h after inoculation showed that CD18 blockade impaired the early (4 h) clearance of E. coli but not S. aureus. These findings suggest that PMN emigration to intrapulmonary S. aureus is largely CD18-independent. In contrast, intrapulmonary E. coli elicits CD18-mediated PMN emigration. CD18 blockade results in impaired clearance of E. coli but not S. aureus from the lung.\nSurvey of the use of peripherally inserted central venous catheters in children. Pediatrics Thiagarajan, R. R., Ramamoorthy, C., Gettmann, T., Bratton, S. L. 1997; 99 (2): E4-?\nUse of peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs) to provide prolonged intravenous (IV) access in children is increasing. Our goal was to describe the children treated with PICCs in our institution, and to study catheter features such as catheter life, completion of therapy, and complications. Furthermore, we also evaluated PICC use in children completing therapy after discharge from our institution.A prospective study of all PICCs inserted at the Children's Hospital and Medical Center (CHMC), a university-affiliated teaching institution, during a period of 18 months (January 1994 to July 1995).A total of 441 PICCs were inserted in 390 patients. Patient age ranged from 0 to 22 years with a mean of 5.4 +/- 6.0 years. No insertion complications occurred. Treatment of infectious disease (46%) was the most frequent reason for PICC insertion. All pediatric medical and surgical services used PICCs. Average catheter life was 13 +/- 12 days. Sixty-one percent of PICCs were used entirely at CHMC, while 39% were also used at home or at an outside hospital. Completion of therapy was achieved in 69% of PICCs. Among children who completed therapy outside our hospital, there was no difference in the rates of occlusion, accidental dislodgment, or infection. One hundred twenty-nine (29%) PICCs were removed for complications. Occlusion (7%), accidental displacement (8%), and suspicion of sepsis (8%) were the most common complications. Only 2% of PICCs had documented catheter-associated sepsis.PICCs provide reliable and safe access for prolonged IV therapy in neonates and children. The low incidence of complications with PICCs make them an attractive device for prolonged IV access. Similar complication rates with use in and out of hospital suggest that home IV therapy can be safely delivered with PICCs, avoiding expensive hospitalization.\nHuman newborns, particularly those born before full term, are more susceptible to bacterial infections as a result of impaired host defense mechanisms. Compared with adults, circulating leukocytes from human newborns (preterm and full-term gestations) and newborn rabbits (full-term gestation) have low resting levels of CD62L (L-selectin) and do not significantly increase surface expression of CD18 after inflammatory stimulation. To determine the potential utility of preterm rabbits in investigations of perinatal human conditions, the authors compared the surface expression of the beta 2-integrin CD18 and CD62L (L-selectin) on polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) from perinatal rabbits and perinatal humans, both under resting conditions and after in vitro activation with inflammatory stimulants.After erythrocyte lysis of whole-blood samples, leukocytes from 7-day-old, full-term (31-day gestation), and preterm (24-day gestation) rabbits, as well as full-term (37-42 week gestation) and preterm (27-36 week gestation) human newborns were prepared and stimulated in vitro at 37 degrees C with either C5a or phorbol myristate acetate. After fluorescence labeling of CD18 and CD62L with monoclonal antibodies, PMN adhesion molecule expression was assessed by flow cytometry.Constitutive CD18 expression was not significantly different between perinatal and adult humans but was reduced in all perinatal rabbits compared with adults. Inflammatory stimulation caused significant increases in CD18 expression in adult human PMNs but not in full-term and preterm newborns. Changes in CD18 expression in adult and preterm rabbits after stimulation, although in the same direction as humans, were more variable. In both species, constitutive CD62L expression on PMNs from all perinates was significantly lower than in adults. However, CD62L was shed to similar degrees after inflammatory stimulation in all groups.Preterm rabbits may provide a potentially useful experimental model to study PMN adhesion and host defense in the perinatal period, particularly preterm gestations. Specific advantages and limitations of rabbits in such studies are discussed.\nLeukocyte adhesion molecule (LAM) blockade reduces ischemia-reperfusion injury. We tested the hypothesis that a monoclonal antibody (MAb) that recognizes a functional epitope of L-selectin would decrease hemorrhagic shock-induced reperfusion injury. Anesthetized rabbits were subjected to 2 h of hemorrhagic shock (cardiac output reduced to 30% of baseline), then given one of the following treatments: MAbs that recognize functional domains of L-selectin (LAM1-3), CD18 (60.3), MAbs that recognize a nonfunctional domain on L-selectin (LAM1-14), or saline, immediately before resuscitation with shed blood. Additional fluids were administered as needed to maintain cardiac output at baseline levels for 6 h. The cumulative fluid resuscitation after MAb LAM1-3 (58 +/- 34 ml/kg) was not significantly different from after MAb 60.3 (21 +/- 24 ml/kg) or MAb LAM1-14 (66 +/- 51 ml/kg), but it was significantly less than saline-treated controls (142 +/- 142 ml/kg). However, two animals treated with MAb LAM1-14 died before 6 h. If their resuscitation volumes are projected to 6 h by linear regression, then the LAM1-14-treated group required significantly greater volume (101 +/- 99 ml/kg) than the MAb LAM1-3-treated group. We conclude that MAbs to a functional domain on L-selectin are protective against reperfusion-injury following hemorrhagic shock.\nAfter Fontan repair in children, we performed a prospective, open-label study to evaluate the effect of amrinone on pulmonary vascular resistance (PVRI). Eight patients who underwent the Fontan repair had baseline arterial pressure, left atrial pressure, central venous pressure, and cardiac output measured postoperatively. Hemodynamic measurements were repeated after amrinone 4.5 mg/kg. The PVRI tended to decrease, but the change was not statistically significant. Although the systemic vascular resistance decreased to 802 +/- 222 from 941 +/- 191 dynes.s.cm-5.m-2 (P < 0.05), mean arterial blood pressure was unchanged. Cardiac index (3.8 +/- 1.2 to 4.7 +/- 1.6 L.min-1.m-2) and stroke volume index (23.6 +/- 6.7 to 30.5 +/- 8.1 mL.beat-1.m-2) increased, and heart rate decreased (160 +/- 21 to 151 +/- 24 bpm) (P < 0.05). Colloid transfusion during amrinone bolus administration was 13.9 mL/kg. The mean serum amrinone concentration was 4.2 micrograms/mL at the end of bolus and clearance was 2.24 mL.kg-1.min-1. Arrhythmias and thrombocytopenia were not noted. We conclude that amrinone administration is effective in increasing cardiac output in children who have undergone a Fontan repair.\nThe correlations between continuous positive-pressure ventilation-induced antidiuresis/antinatriuresis, atrial transmural pressure, and atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations have not been clarified. The purpose of the present study was to use aggressive hydration to restore atrial transmural pressure during continuous positive-pressure ventilation and to test for correlations of atrial transmural pressure, atrial natriuretic peptide concentration, diuresis, and natriuresis during this intervention. An intrapleural catheter was used to measure atrial transmural pressure in three ways: a) right atrial pressure minus intrapleural pressure, b) left ventricular end-diastolic pressure minus intrapleural pressure, and c) pulmonary artery occlusion pressure minus intrapleural pressure. Hemodynamic, atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations, and renal measurements were made in 12 anesthetized closed-chest dogs during baseline (intermittent positive-pressure ventilation), during continuous positive-pressure ventilation), during continuous positive-pressure ventilation with 10 cm H2O end-expiratory pressure, and during continuous positive-pressure ventilation plus aggressive hydration (approximately 60 mL/kg lactated Ringer's solution). Pearson's correlation matrix was used to generate all possible correlation coefficients between the three atrial transmural pressures, atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations, urine output, and urine sodium excretion.Application of continuous positive-pressure ventilation resulted in a 60% decrease in right atrial transmural pressure (p less than .05), a 51% decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic transmural pressure (p less than .05), and a 26% decrease in pulmonary artery occlusion transmural pressure (p less than .05) from baseline. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentration decreased from 80 +/- 12 (SEM) pg/mL at baseline to 49 +/- 8 pg/mL during continuous positive-pressure ventilation (p less than .05). Both urine output and sodium excretion decreased by 81% (p less than .05). After aggressive hydration with lactated Ringer's solution during continuous positive-pressure ventilation, to restore atrial transmural pressure to baseline, plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentration returned to baseline values (81 +/- 12 pg/mL) as did urine output and sodium excretion. Correlation indices (r2 values) between transmural pressure, atrial natriuretic peptide concentration, urine output, and sodium excretion ranged from .835 to .994. Multivariate analysis of covariance demonstrated significant (p less than .05) temporal dependence between the three transmural pressures, atrial natriuretic peptide concentration, urine output, and sodium excretion.The results demonstrate that aggressive hydration during continuous positive-pressure ventilation will restore diuresis and natriuresis and that this response correlates significantly with atrial transmural filling pressure and plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentration."

        "input": "BOCA RATON \u2014 On the heels of a vicious debate, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum on Thursday decried the nasty nature of the nationally watched Florida race but at the same time likened his Republican opponent, Ron DeSantis, to a temperamental child.\nGillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, kicked off a bus",
        "output": "tour in Miami, visited three college campuses and appeared at a temple in Plantation, with early voting underway and the clock winding down on the Nov. 6 election.\nSpeaking to a crowd of several hundred students and supporters Thursday afternoon at an auditorium on the Florida Atlantic University campus, Gillum mocked DeSantis\u2019 performance during Wednesday\u2019s second debate, during which the Republican exploded during questioning from moderator Todd McDermott.\nDeSantis, whose endorsement by President Donald Trump helped the former congressman coast to victory in the August GOP primary, lost his cool when McDermott asked him about his relationship with conservative author David Horowitz.\nDeSantis \u201ccame a little undone yesterday,\u201d Gillum began, after asking the crowd if they had tuned into the debate, which was the final face-to-face matchup between the candidates.\n\u201cHe fell into the category of demonstrating the temperament of about a 4-year-old. I\u2019m trying not to offend my kids, because I\u2019ve got twin 4-year-olds. I certainly don\u2019t want them to take their example from him,\u201d Gillum said.\nDeSantis \u201ccollapsed under the pressure\u201d of being asked about \u201cracist conferences that he\u2019s attended\u201d and about his facilitation of a Facebook group accused of being anti-Semitic and \u201ctinged with racism,\u201d Gillum said.\nDeSantis said, as a prosecutor, he \u201cstood up for victims of every race, color and creed\u201d and will \u201crepresent all the people\u201d as governor.\n\u201cEveryone will get a fair shake. But I\u2019m not going to bow down to the altar of political correctness. I\u2019m not going to let the media smear me,\u201d he angrily continued.\nGillum, who is black, and his supporters have made racism a major theme of the Democrat\u2019s campaign. The day after the Aug. 28 primary, DeSantis drew widespread criticism after warning supporters \u201cnot to monkey this up,\u201d referring to the state\u2019s success under Gov. Rick Scott, by electing Gillum. DeSantis has also been blasted for refusing to return a campaign contribution to a donor who used the \u201cn-word\u201d in reference to former President Barack Obama.\nDuring his 30-minute stump speech Thursday, Gillum reminded the audience about his opponent\u2019s \u201cmonkey this up\u201d comment, adding that there\u2019s been \u201ca lot more of the same\u201d throughout the race.\nDeSantis and his supporters, meanwhile, have accused Gillum of being dishonest and corrupt for accepting a ticket from an undercover FBI agent to the popular Broadway show, \u201cHamilton,\u201d and traveling to Costa Rica and other places with lobbyist Adam Corey. Gillum said he paid cash for his share of a rental house shared with Corey and others in the 2016 Costa Rica vacation.\nThe trips and the ticket are part of an ethics investigation into Gillum, and Corey is at the heart of a federal probe into Tallahassee city government.

        "output": "about a year ago. \"Trading ahead of other investors based on information about orders that other investors can't see could violate insider-trading laws,\" an FBI spokesperson explained to the Journal. The FBI joins investigations into high-frequency trading by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Attorney General's office. CBS News and various others have confirmed the existence of the FBI's investigation.\nIn a report on 60 Minutes last night, based on an excerpt from his latest book published in The New York Times Magazine on Monday, author Michael Lewis explained a not-so-frequently discussed Wall Street practice of electronically trading shares at a rapid pace to take advantage of the daily ebbs and flows of the market, commonly known as high-frequency trading. The practice is the focus of Lewis' latest book, Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt. In theory, traders react to moves made by others in the market, buying and selling stock accordingly as prices go up and down. But some, like the Royal Bank of Canada, accuse high-frequency traders of using advanced computer algorithms and ultra-high speed data network to manipulate stock prices through the millisecond advantages they have over humans, and even other computer networks. The practice even allows for a technique called \"front-selling,\" where traders place an order to purchase a stock, and HFT computers using their speed advantage to start buying the same stock before the original order is even processed. The legality of this practice was questionable well before the FBI investigation.\nThe FBI says it has dedicated a large number of agents to the investigation. They are looking at proprietary-trading outfits as well as fast-trading operations at brokers who buy and sell orders on behalf of clients, such as mutual funds and pension plans. FBI officials are looking into whether some brokers trade on information about clients orders before executing on behalf of the client and whether brokers use information about after-hours trading to beat the market when it opens the next morning.\n\"There are many people in government who are very focused on this and who are concerned about it and who think it breaks the law,\" an FBI spokesman said."

They were right.\nWhen Zuma appointed Magashule as premier of the Free State in 2009, the doors to the provincial treasury were flung open and \"King Ace\", as some in the province refer to him, finally had unfettered access to the poor province's largesse.\nHe became untouchable and pulled-off what some call the first capture of a state \u2013 the Free State.\nWhen I visited Bloemfontein over the years to interview sources about allegations that Magashule was robbing the province blind, I was met with complete unsurprise. Yes, nothing gets done in this place without Ace's approval or involvement, I was told.\nShortly after his appointment as premier, I received a tip-off that he demanded a R10m bribe to approve a transaction through the Free State Gambling Board. Although Magashule had no business involving himself in the transaction, the affected businessman was summoned to his office and had to elicit the assistance of Zuma ally Vivian Reddy to get his deal approved.\nOpaque meetings at the Shell Ultra City in Kroonstad, bogus contracts typed on a laptop to formalise \"facilitation fees\"\u2026 it was all part of the reign of King Ace.\nThere was a tacit acceptance of the rotten state of affairs and a hopelessness that there was no chance for you to prosper as a businessperson or government official if you weren't prepared to have your palms greased or do the greasing.\nAnd this was before the Guptas arrived on the scene.\nOne of the saddest aspects of Magashule's decade of Free State capture was the weak reporting on the province by the provincial and national media. Partly because of the declining media industry, including a weakened SABC, and partly because of Magashule's active and aggressive attempts to influence and even purchase journalists and publications in Bloemfontein, the full extent of his activities remained largely under the radar.\nWas it not for the reporting of Volksblad, the Afrikaans daily newspaper in the city, much of what Magashule and his gang were up to would have remained completely unreported.\nI am exceptionally glad that former News24 investigative journalist Pieter-Louis Myburgh took the time and effort to produce his excellent book Gangster State: Unravelling Ace Magashule's Web of Capture, that finally blows the lid off Magashule's reign of looting and deceit.\nThe book is a horror story of what happens to a province, particularly one in the rural parts of South Africa with little media attention, when a crooked politician takes the reins.\nCoupled with evidence that is expected to be delivered to the Zondo Commission over the next few days and weeks, the truth about Magashule's term as premier of the Free State is finally coming out.\nIronically, Magashule's elevation to secretary-general of the ANC has weakened his grip on the Free State. He can no longer keep things under wraps from Luthuli House.\nAs the chief driver of the ANC's election machine, these revelations will further damage the governing party's chances to breach the 60% mark on May 8.\nVoters would be justified to ask who exactly they are voting for if they put their crosses next to the ANC on the ballot paper.

We show you how.\nHard drive capacities are quickly expanding, with internal desktop drives approaching the half-terabyte mark. The amount of data you can store on today's consumer hard drives was unthinkable even a decade ago, but huge apps and",
        "output": "multimedia files have pushed this expansion. As the amount of data stored increases, so does the need to organize it. This usually means setting up a number of directories, but multiple partitions are another great way to manage high-capacity drives. A number of tools exist to make this easy, such as Norton PartitionMagic 8.01, our Editors' Choice (see our review at http://go.pcmag.com/partitionmagic801 ) among partitioning programs. But whereas PartitionMagic costs $70, the open-source community has a free graphical partitioning tool with many advanced functions: QTParted. Running QTParted from a bootable Linux CD-ROM or DVD is the safest way to use the program, and a method that lets even Windows users run it.\nPartitions split a hard drive into sections. Desktop computers generally come configured with only a single partition, usually labeled C: in Microsoft Windows. Think of such a drive as a large house with no interior walls\u0097just a single general-purpose room. Nearly all houses separate different sections into special-purpose areas, such as bedrooms, kitchens, and bathrooms, to make better use of the space. Hard drive partitions operate on the same principle.\nOne common reason for partitioning is to install several operating systems on the same drive. The first partition might have Windows XP; the second, Windows 2000; and a third, Linux\u0097each OS in its own container. Some PC vendors use multiple partitions for system recovery\u0097the first partition fills most of the drive and holds the operating system, while the second contains a recovery image. Another common use for partitioning is to separate out data. The first partition is devoted to the core operating-system files; the second is for programs, games, or general storage. This has the extra advantage of protecting you in case of file-system errors. Should an error or hard reset corrupt the second partition, the first may remain intact.\nRepartitioning, resizing, or moving a partition is risky, whatever tool you use. Back up any crucial data on a partition before you resize it.\nAccording to the Web site ( http://qtparted.sourceforge.net ), QTParted is designed as a Linux-based clone of PartitionMagic. The utility provides a simple interface for you to create, delete, move, resize, format, and otherwise manage partitions. Probably the best way to use QTParted is from a bootable Linux disc, since resizing or moving partitions you're currently booted into is risky. Many bootable Linux distributions, Knoppix among the most notable, include QTParted.\nAfter Knoppix boots (type knoppix at the boot prompt), start at the large letter K at bottom left. Select K | System | QTParted to launch the utility. The main window is split into left and right panes. The left lists any hard drives (and possibly optical drives) that QTParted detects. Click the drive you want to edit (your first\u0097or C:\u0097drive will most likely be labeled /dev/hda, your second /dev/hdb, and so on), and QTParted will scan it for partition information, displaying the details in the right pane. The top section of the right pane displays the hard drive and any partitions in graphical form. Below you'll see detailed information on each partition, including file-system type, size, space used, and where the partition starts and ends on the drive. To see the list of changes you can make, either right-click a partition or select it and click the Operations menu.\nSince the default on many systems is a single partition for the complete drive, to create extra partitions you must first resize the existing one to make room. Before resizing a Windows partition, be sure to boot into Windows and defrag the drive. After you've completed these preparations, select the partition and choose the Resize operation. The window that appears will let you drag on the partition's representation from either side to shrink or grow it, or you can manually set the size. Click on OK, and the main window will display your new partition and the free space you've created.\nTo make a new partition from free space, select the space and choose the Create operation. Set the partition type and size, and tell QTParted whether to put it at the start or end of the free space. To move a partition within free space, choose the Move operation and drag the partition or manually enter its start and ending locations in the window that appears.\nAthough the utility will now show changes, you haven't changed the actual drive yet\u0097-QTParted is only showing you the potential results of the operations. The tool keeps track of your changes and lets you undo them at any time until they are committed. To write the changes to the drive, click on File | Commit. A confirmation window will appear, and once you click on OK, the program makes the changes. Many require a reboot to take effect; click on K and choose Logout to reboot. If you resize a Windows partition, run Chkdsk on it at the next reboot if Windows doesn't do so automatically.\nQTParted lacks some features that PartitionMagic has, such as merging partitions; converting between FAT, FAT32, and NTFS file systems; copying individual files between partitions; and managing boot options. Still, for resizing and creating new partitions, QTParted is an easy-to-use, free tool that is as reliable as commercial tools.\nKyle is a systems administrator for The Green Sheet, Inc., the current president of the North Bay Linux Users' Group North, and the author of Knoppix Hacks.

        "output": "debated based on mixed evidence whether a father's age is linked to his child's vulnerability to individual disorders like autism and schizophrenia. Some studies have found strong associations, while others have found weak associations or none at all.\nThe new report, which looked at many mental disorders in Sweden, should inflame the debate, if not settle it, experts said. Men have a biological clock of sorts because of random mutations in sperm over time, the report suggests, and the risks associated with later fatherhood may be higher than previously thought.\nThe findings were published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Psychiatry.\n\"This is the best paper I've seen on this topic, and it suggests several lines of inquiry into mental illness,\" said Dr. Patrick Sullivan, a professor of genetics at the University of North Carolina, who was not involved in the research. \"But the last thing people should do is read this and say, 'Oh no, I had a kid at 43, the kid's doomed.' The vast majority of kids born to older dads will be just fine.\"\nDr. Kenneth Kendler, a professor of psychiatry and human molecular genetics at Virginia Commonwealth University, also urged caution in interpreting the results.\nThe research team, led by Brian D'Onofrio of Indiana University, analyzed medical and public records of some 2.6 million people born in Sweden from 1973 to 2001. Like many European countries, Sweden has centralized medical care and keeps detailed records.\nCompared with the children of young fathers, ages 20-24, those born to men age 45 and older had about twice the risk of developing psychosis, the signature symptom of schizophrenia; more than three times the likelihood of receiving a diagnosis of autism; and about 13 times the chance of having a diagnosis of attention deficit disorder. Children born to older fathers also tended to struggle more with academics and substance abuse.\nThe researchers controlled for every factor they could think of, including parents' education and income. The researchers say that any increased risk due solely to paternal age is most likely a result of the accumulation of genetic mutations in sperm cells.\n\"It's a plausible hypothesis at this point,\" Sullivan said.\nExperts say the numbers in the study look more alarming than they probably are. For example, Sullivan said, the overall prevalence of autism is 0.5 percent to 1 percent of the population, depending on the estimate and the location.\nBut for the children of healthy parents in their 20s, the rate is perhaps 1 in 300, or even lower. A threefold increase would put the odds at about 1 in 100, still very low.\nThe same goes for the risk of psychosis. The baseline rate is tiny for the children of young, healthy parents, and remains quite low even when doubled.\nThe researchers found much larger increases in risk for attention deficits (13-fold) and bipolar disorder (25-fold) associated with late fatherhood.\n\"I don't know what to do with those numbers,\" Sullivan said, noting that two recent genetic studies found that the contribution of de novo mutations to the risk of mental disorders was \"probably pretty low\" compared with other factors."

It happened that he had been seeking a ministerial job with the emperors of the Eastern Zhou dynasty (\u201cSpring and Autumn\u201d period) (\u6625\u79cb) but his efforts proved futile after traveling among the kingdoms for more than a decade. One day as he was wandering in the woods he came upon some profusely growing orchids which moved him to say: \u201c\u592b\u862d\u7576\u70ba\u738b\u8005\u9999, \u4eca\u4e43\u7368\u8302, \u8207\u773e\u8349\u70ba\u4f0d, \u8b6c\u7336\u8ce2\u8005\u4e0d\u9022\u6642, \u8207\u9119\u592b\u70ba\u502b\u4e5f.\u201d (my translation: \u201cThe orchids\u2019 fragrance should be enjoyed by royalties in their residence, but they now look so solitary amongst grasses in the wild. They are not unlike noble scholars whom no one appreciates and who have to be contented with the company of the philistine class.\u201d) Confucius likened his not being appreciated by emperors to the solitary orchids in the woods not being cherished by royalties as they should. In that era, orchids were a scarce species that only royalties and the noble class could afford to use as ornament plants in their homes.\nConfucius also thought of the orchid as a flower of noble character, as he said in \u201c\u5b54\u5b50\u5bb6\u8a9e\u201d (\u201cConfucius\u2019 Family Dialogue\u201d): \u201c\u829d\u862d\u751f\u65bc\u68ee\u6797, \u4e0d\u70ba\u7121\u4eba\u800c\u4e0d\u82b3, \u541b\u5b50\u4fee\u9053\u7acb\u5fb7, \u4e0d\u70ba\u7aae\u56f0\u800c\u6539\u7bc0\u201d (my translation: \u201cThe orchids grow in the woods and they let out their fragrance even if there is no one around to appreciate it. Likewise, men of noble character will not let poverty deter their will to be guided by high principles and morals.\u201d In short, orchids symbolized nobleness and tenacity of character.\nThe light yet lingering unique fragrance of the orchid also had a profound effect on Confucius. He said \u201c\u8207\u5584\u4eba\u5c45, \u5982\u5165\u829d\u862d\u4e4b\u5ba4, \u4e45\u800c\u4e0d\u805e\u5176\u9999, \u5373\u8207\u4e4b\u5316\u77e3. \u8207\u4e0d\u5584\u4eba\u5c45, \u5982\u5165\u9b91\u9b5a\u4e4b\u8086, \u4e45\u800c\u4e0d\u805e\u5176\u81ed, \u4ea6\u8207\u4e4b\u5316\u77e3.\u201d (my translation: \u201cIf you are in the company of good people, it is like entering a room full of orchids. After a while, you become soaked in the fragrance and you don\u2019t even notice it. If you are in the company of bad people, it is like going into a room that smells of fish. After a while, you don\u2019t notice the fishy smell as you have been immersed in it.\u201d The orchid\u2019s fragrance was used to portray the sublimity of character which Confucius believed everyone should strive for and which formed the basis of his moral preaching, and to emphasize the influential power of people of such character.\nSince the Confucian era, the orchid symbolism has been widely used in literary works. In both classic and modern literature, the plum (\u6885), the orchid (\u862d), the chrysanthemum (\u83ca) and the bamboo (\u7af9) are referred to as \u201cthe noble four\u201d (\u56db\u541b\u5b50) of plants.\nThus one can see how much of history and literary background can be inferred in one simple character like \u201c\u862d\u201d (orchid), and the above is hardly an exhaustive source of relevant historical and literary information, although it is the most common source.\nWhy Have China\u2019s Reforms Stalled?"

Year over year, the total number of breaches slipped by 3.2% and the number of exposed records fell",
        "output": "by 35.9%.\nThe 12 largest breaches alone accounted for 74% of all exposed records. Each of those dozen incidents exposed more than 100 million records.\nThe United States experienced nearly 35% (2,264) of all breaches, far more than any other country, and also recorded the highest number of exposed records with 2.26 billion (44.4% of the year\u2019s total). The United Kingdom suffered 144 data breaches that exposed 19.6 million records, while Canada posted the third highest number of breaches with 112.\nIndia recorded 82 data breaches and the second-highest number of exposed records with 1.28 billion. China suffered just 12, but the median number of records exposed in those incidents ran to 10 million per breach and the total number of exposed records came to 332.5 million, the third-highest total in the world.\nIt\u2019s been an unusual year for breach activity. We\u2019ve been monitoring breach events for more than a dozen years now and this is the first time we\u2019ve observed a slow start to the year followed by a growing number of disclosures as the months pass. We suspect various factors including the allure of crypto mining had an impact on breach activity early in the year, but disclosures rebounded throughout the summer and into the last quarter.\nThe security firm also noted that of 5,149 breaches with a confirmed discovery method, only 680 (13.2%) were discovered by the organization responsible for protecting the data. The average number of days between discovery and disclosure rose from 48.6 in 2017 to 49.6 last year. That additional delay surprised the researchers who expected that the new GDPR reporting rules would shorten the time between discovery and public disclosure.\nFacebook Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) logged two of 2018\u2019s 10 breaches revealing the most records (117 million in total), although the largest worldwide breach was the exposure of some 1.1 billion records in India in a single incident. Under Armour Inc. (NYSE: UAA) exposed 150 million records of users of its MyFitnessPal app, and hotel and resort operator Marriott International Inc. (NYSE: MAR) discovered a leak of some 383 million loyalty program members\u2019 records that had been occurring since 2014.\nEmail addresses were exposed in 61% of the breaches, more than any other data type, with passwords a close second at 57%. Social Security numbers were exposed in about 14% of the incidents and credit card numbers were revealed in about 12%.\nThe number of records exposed did come down about 36% compared to last year and while the number of breaches is still quite high, we did not see a repeat of widespread events like WannaCry and Petya/NotPetya. After year upon year of bad news, we\u2019ll take improvement where it can be found.\nThe Risk Based Security report offers more details and information on last year\u2019s data breaches. The report also contains a list of the 20 largest data breaches of all time."

        "output": "of Xinjiang have resulted in 27 victims, almost all protesters killed by police who opened fire on them. The violence took place in the desert area near Turpan, about 280 km from the provincial capital Urumqi. According to the official news agency Xinhua, the officers opened fire on \"a mob of rioters.\"\nBefore the police opened fire 17 people had already died (9 police officers and 8 civilians). The crowd had stormed a police station and a government building. A local official speaking anonymously, said officers \"opened fire on the crowd\" to protect the buildings killing 10 civilians. Several dozen were injured on both sides, who have since been admitted to the local hospital.\nThe spark that ignited the clashes is unclear. The province has long been the epicenter of violence and tensions between the ethnic Uyghur - once the majority in the area - and Han. The central government in Beijing has encouraged the emigration of Han to the province in an attempt to \"balance out\" the social reality of Xinjiang, but the ongoing fighting is proof that the experiment has failed.\nThe Uyghurs are Turkic-speaking Muslims: for several decades they have had an adversarial relationship with the Chinese central government. After a few (unsuccessful) attempts to gain independence as \"East Turkestan\", the ethnic leaders have asked Beijing to be allowed to safeguard their local language, culture and religion. The Chinese government - while giving tax breaks and social benefits - decided instead to use a heavy hand and launched a campaign of repression and control in the whole area. The heavy hand of the regime is felt even on the Islamic religious community, suspected of propagating a terrorist and fundamentalist vision of Islam. Islamic publications are censored, the sermons of imams controlled and young people under the age of 18 are banned from attending the mosque."

Now, he\u2019s selecting officials for his Cabinet who likely won\u2019t try to reduce the use of fossil fuels.\nFor Democrats, the lingering question of whether it was demographic or economic anxiety that primarily motivated Donald Trump\u2019s coalition is a",
        "output": "little like poet Robert Frost asking whether the world will end in fire or ice.\nThe answer may be the same, too. Frost, of course, concluded that either would do the job. \u201cI hold with those who favor fire,\u201d he wrote, before adding: \u201cfor destruction ice/Is also great/And would suffice.\u201d Likewise, with Trump, the accumulating evidence suggests his core voters feel eclipsed by both the cultural and economic changes reshaping American life.\nTrump\u2019s polarizing appeal has deepened the existing geographic and demographic fault lines in American politics into a chasm so imposing it could mark the border between two countries. On one side, Hillary Clinton routed Trump in the racially and culturally diverse metropolitan centers that are helping forge a globalized, information-based, and low-carbon economy. On the other, Trump posted crushing margins in the places that feel eclipsed, or threatened, by all of those trends.\nThe latest evidence of this widening divide comes from Trump\u2019s repeated selection of oil-industry allies for key Cabinet positions: Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson for secretary of state, former Texas Governor Rick Perry for secretary of energy, and Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt as the Environmental Protection Agency administrator. Tillerson and Perry have both displayed some nuance in their approach to energy. But, overall, with those choices, Trump has indelibly endorsed the fear that reducing carbon emissions to combat the destabilizing threat of global climate change will undermine economic growth.\nExperience simply doesn\u2019t justify that fear. As Mark Muro, policy director at the Brookings Institution\u2019s Metropolitan Policy Program, calculated in an important recent analysis, since 2000 the United States increased its economic output by 30 percent while reducing carbon emissions by 10 percent. Over that period, he reported, fully 33 states grew their economies while reducing their emissions.\nYet despite these reductions, the states most bound to the fossil-fuel economy, like Oklahoma and Texas, still emit vastly more carbon per person than greener states do. And that energy divide now almost perfectly tracks the current political divide.\nComparing the latest federal figures on states\u2019 per capita carbon emissions with the 2016 election results produces a clear pattern. Trump carried all of the 22 states with the most per capita carbon emissions, except for New Mexico, and 27 of the top 32 in all. (Colorado, Illinois, Delaware, and Minnesota were the Clinton-voting exceptions.) The Democratic nominee won 15 of the 18 states with the lowest per capita emissions\u2014with the exception of Florida, North Carolina, and Idaho.\nThis divergence sharpened the pattern already evident under President Obama. Among the 18 lowest-emitting states, Clinton lost only one\u2014Florida\u2014that Obama carried in 2012. But among the top 32 emitters, five Rustbelt states that Obama won last time flipped to Trump: Iowa, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan.\nWith only a few exceptions, cultural dynamics reinforce these economic contrasts. The high-carbon states\u2014centered on the Plains, the Mountain West, and portions of the South\u2014also tend to be more rural, more religiously traditional, and often less racially diverse than the low-carbon states. Following that trail, American politics seems destined to increasingly align the Democratic Party with voters most comfortable with the nation\u2019s hurtling economic, demographic, and cultural change\u2014and the Republican party with voters most resistant to it.\nThat resistance can\u2019t reverse the change\u2014on any front. Kids of color will comprise a majority of the under-18 population soon after 2020. Though Clinton won less than one-sixth of America\u2019s counties, Muro\u2019s research found her counties account for nearly two-thirds of the nation\u2019s total economic output. And even Trump\u2019s greatest exertions aren\u2019t likely to reverse the long-term shift from high- to lower-carbon alternatives in both energy sources\u2014from coal to natural gas and renewables\u2014and economic activities\u2014from manufacturing to services and digital innovation.\nThe Democrats\u2019 challenge is that their coalition has crumbled in states that fear these changes, particularly in the Rustbelt, faster than it has coalesced in the states benefiting from them, which are mostly across the Sunbelt. To recapture the White House in four years, they\u2019ll need recovery on both fronts. But the Democrats\u2019 long-term prospects will likely rely on accelerating their leap across these overlapping economic, cultural, and energy divides.\nThough renewable sources are gaining ground in some Midwest states, Democrats face structural challenges in a preponderantly white and older region where manufacturing powered by low-cost, coal-generated electricity looms so large. More promising for them may be racially diversifying Sunbelt states that are also decoupling from fossil fuels as they shift toward both renewable energy sources and post-industrial employment. Already, Georgia, Arizona, North Carolina, and Florida rank in the bottom 20 states for carbon emissions.\nReflected in choices like his oil-drenched Cabinet, Trump\u2019s agenda looks to mid-20th century America as its inspiration\u2014not only culturally, but also in its vision of an economy where manufacturing and fossil fuels play a larger role, and immigrants and imports a smaller one, than they do today. Smart Democrats will recognize that, in the process, he\u2019s leaving them an opening with the industries and regions more likely to propel growth in this century. Against the ice of Trump\u2019s restoration, Democrats may have no choice but to stoke the fire of transformation."

        "output": "6, 2017.\nWith strong winds blowing and bone-dry conditions, utility officials in San Diego on Thursday began shutting off the power to thousands of people \u2014 a pre-emptive move to reduce the danger of power lines sparking wildfires.\nIt\u2019s a controversial approach that may soon become a growing trend across California.\nAs huge fires continued to envelope parts of Los Angeles and Ventura counties, San Diego Gas & Electric cut electricity to 12,000 customers in San Diego County by Thursday afternoon, after Santa Ana winds reached 88 mph in some rural areas.\nEven though no fires were burning in San Diego County on Thursday morning, the utility notified up to 170,000 customers that they could have their power shut off by Saturday as a safety precaution, and that electricity in some affected communities wouldn\u2019t be back on until Monday.\nWith the number of fires in the West growing due to climate change, and a recent decision by the state Public Utilities Commission to require that a utility \u2014 not ratepayers \u2014 pick up the costs for fires caused by its power lines, it\u2019s likely that Californians are going to see more deliberate, pre-planned power outages when there is extreme wildfire risk, experts say.\n\u201cThe utilities are damned if they do, damned if they don\u2019t,\u201d said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economics professor who has studied energy issues extensively.\nTrees falling into power lines or wires blowing off power poles can spark fires that can kill dozens of people and level entire neighborhoods, so turning off the power amid extreme conditions \u2014 high temperatures, low humidity and strong winds \u2014 is a logical tool to reduce risk, Wolak said, but it also creates major headaches.\nAmong the problems from planned blackouts: Food in refrigerators can go bad. Stores have to close. Traffic lights, elevators and garage-door openers don\u2019t work. Medical equipment that elderly or infirm people might have at home, like respirators, can shut down. People who work from home can lose power to their computers. Water pumps may not work.\nWolak said the solution is probably to harden the power grid. That would require such measures as replacing wooden poles with steel poles, better insulating power lines, and in some places, burying lines, which is very expensive. Those costs would all be passed along to ratepayers, he noted, but that may be part of society\u2019s cost of adjusting to climate change, similar to the cost of building stronger levees and sea walls as sea levels continue to rise.\n\u201cCustomers and politicians have to recognize that in a world where fires and other extreme weather events are going to be more severe, that argues in favor of building a more robust system, and that costs money,\u201d Wolak said.\nWith huge fires raging in Los Angeles and Ventura, around 11 a.m., Thursday, a fire began in northern San Diego County in Fallbrook, near Camp Pendleton, and had burned 2,500 acres by mid-afternoon. The fire forced the evacuation of two schools and the closure of two lanes of Interstate 15 in an area where San Diego Gas & Electric had not shut off power beforehand.\nCalifornia has seen the problem of wildfires caused by power lines take center stage in recent months.\nIn one of the worst disasters in modern California history, a series of fires that began Oct. 8 in Napa, Sonoma, Mendocino and other Northern California counties burned more than 245,000 acres, destroyed 8,900 homes and killed 44 people.\nCal Fire has not yet determined how the blazes started, but investigators are looking at whether power lines owned by PG&E were at fault for some of the fires, stoked by windy conditions. The utility has told investors it faces massive liabilities if it is found to have caused the fires, and on Wednesday State Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones said insured losses from the fires so far total $9 billion.\nMeanwhile, financial risk to the utilities is rising. Last week, the PUC rejected a request from San Diego Gas & Electric to recover $379 million from its ratepayers after investigators found its power lines sparked three huge fires in 2007. By a 5-0 vote, the commissioners said that the San Diego utility had not operated its electrical system in a \u201creasonable and prudent\u201d manner when the fires began, as state law requires.\nAs a result, the commissioners ruled, San Diego Gas & Electric\u2019s shareholders, not its customers, must absorb the costs. That ruling sent shock waves across the utility industry.\nAfter the 2007 fires, San Diego Gas & Electric asked the PUC for permission to shut down some power lines during dry, windy conditions to reduce fire risk. Disability groups said they wanted customers to be notified in advance so they could prepare. The PUC, in a 2012 ruling, granted the utility the authority to shut off power ahead of time, but \u201conly as a last resort, and only when SDG&E is convinced there is a significant risk that strong Santa Ana winds will topple power lines onto flammable vegetation.\u201d The PUC required the utility to notify the public ahead of time, and to file a report to the PUC detailing wind, temperature, humidity and other conditions to see if the act was justified.\nConsumer groups \u2014 who want to keep costs low and improve safety \u2014 are still struggling to come up with a position on the issue."

The artist Guy Yanai, the young fashion designer Maya Reik of cult label Marei 1998, her boyfriend Ross Belfer, founder of a local PR firm, and I are squeezed around a small circular table on the terrace of a restaurant called Port Said. It\u2019s heaving, but the actual interior space is tiny \u2013 just a bar and a DJ working the turntable. The restaurant\u2019s large window is like a small stage, the city\u2019s creative set spilling out across the terrace to the pavement beyond. In between sips of cooled Israeli white wine we dig in to a flurry of small plates that materialise at 20-minute intervals: garlicky Jericho green beans with lemon and olive oil, a sublime msabbaha, its whole chickpeas floating in a creamy tahini sauce. All this euphoric revelry is happening just steps away from \u2013 and with a dramatic view of \u2013 a theatrically lit, monumental Great Synagogue, built in the 1920s and then radically reinvented with striking, sculpted modernist fa\u00e7ades by the architect Aryeh Elhanani.\nWelcome to Tel Aviv, a hedonistic and booming little Miami on the Mediterranean that sits around 50 miles from the Gaza Strip, one of the world\u2019s most incendiary regions. Throughout its streets, tower cranes swivel above construction sites, and tourism numbers keep breaking records. Even the Duke of Cambridge paid a visit recently to meet the city\u2019s entrepreneurs and young artists.\nAlthough Port Said is located in Lev Hair, the centre of the city\u2019s Bauhaus architecture district, for years now Tel Aviv\u2019s creative scene has been moving south: interestingly the \u201cnewest\u201d dynamic, compelling neighbourhood is its old city, Jaffa, which dates back several thousand years. (Modern Tel Aviv, in contrast, was founded just over 100 years ago). Traditionally populated by Arabs, Jaffa is one of the places in Israel where Muslims, Christians and Jews have co-existed, albeit often uneasily, for centuries. Its crumbling, luminous sandstone and limestone buildings are built like layers of honeycomb around its ancient port. In recent years its flea market, Shuk Hapishpeshim, which dates from the 1890s, has evolved into a hipster nexus on a par with east London, with industrial storage buildings and cavernous antique shops being taken over by caf\u00e9s, restaurants and independent boutiques.\nMy compulsion to travel through Israel, as is the case for so many others, was to understand its future as well as its past. The country often appears to be on the verge of totally unravelling in the face of political contention (not least after the Israeli government\u2019s recent, controversial ratifying of the Jewish Nation-State Law) \u2013 which all but dictates that there\u2019s little that is actually relaxing about a trip to this part of the world. Instead, it\u2019s a journey of surprising, provocative and sometimes unsettling contradictions \u2013 one that combines profound history with a vigorous and dynamic contemporary art scene, ancient sacred landscapes and world-class food that fuses Arabic influences with those from the diverse regions of the Jewish diaspora. Tova Wald, founder of one of the country\u2019s most exclusive travel operators, who has designed trips for the likes of Denzel Washington and DreamWorks co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg, says, \u201cIn Jerusalem you can walk along the same paths that King David and Jesus did. You can explore newly unearthed archaeological finds\u201d \u2013 like the recently uncovered Roman theatre near the Western Wall, buried for almost 2,000 years \u2013 \u201cor surreal modernist architecture like the Shrine of the Book, home to the Dead Sea Scrolls. Or villages of the Druze community, a unique, Arab-speaking, monotheistic religious minority that branched off from Islam around the 11th century.\u201d For years, however, Israel as a tourism destination has had two problems, she notes. Service was a bit problematic; and there was a dearth of hotels. \u201cBut now there are several excellent hotel options in both Tel Aviv and Jerusalem; and others opening in Galilee and beyond, finally allowing for a singular, and comfortable, circuit of the country,\u201d she says. The fact that by the end of 2019, Six Senses will be launching one of its most dramatic resorts to date \u2013 the Six Senses Shaharut, a surreally beautiful property carved into the Arava Valley of the Negev desert \u2013 confirms the growing global fascination with Israel\u2019s ancient physical landscape, its troubled contemporary political one notwithstanding.\nWhat\u2019s equally compelling is the impressive number of world-class contemporary cultural sites the country is now home to, from the newly opened Memorial Hall of Israel\u2019s Fallen on Mount Herzl \u2013 a monumental swirl of bricks that spirals into the earth \u2013 to the Suzanne Dellal Centre, the headquarters of the internationally renowned Batsheva Dance Company, due to complete a major renovation this month. On my way south to Jerusalem, I visited perhaps the best known of these: the Design Museum Holon, in a nondescript Tel Aviv suburb, a Ron Arad-designed building that\u2019s a joyful loop of giant ribbons of painted Corten steel.\nUnder a gnarled mulberry tree meant to represent the Tree of Life, in a small square outside the Chamber of the Holocaust Museum, we met Yizar Hass, a guide with Wald, and a philosophy scholar. It was dark; I could just make out his face as he served us tea. Sounds of lecturing Orthodox Jewish rabbis spilled out of the open windows of the Diaspora Yeshiva; the lights of Jerusalem spread below us; the air was redolent of tea and old stones, still warm from the day\u2019s sun.\n\u201cSome people, even non-religious people, have significant spiritual experiences here,\u201d said Hass as he led us into King David\u2019s Tomb. The only remaining tourists were Orthodox families; the women in the female prayer room rocked gently, their lips moving as they prayed. We made our way through the massive Zion Gate into the Old City and wandered a maze of alleyways to the Western Wall. Approaching it this way allowed us to peer into the newly excavated Roman theatre, while also observing the hundreds of pilgrims praying, singing and crying at the Wall. In a place where mythical, religious and historic narratives are nearly impossible to untangle, an ancient theatre was an apt allegory, one that left me with a vertigo completely unrelated to the height from which I was looking down at this new fissure onto the past.\nThe road from Jerusalem to Galilee, following the Jordanian border, is a journey through biblical landscapes: vast undulating rocky deserts, majestic date palm groves. After a couple of hours, I arrived outside the fortified walls of Acre, a small, slow-paced port city reminiscent of the Barbary coastal towns of Morocco. During the 11th century, Acre was a chief port used by the Crusaders, a gateway to the Holy Land, and the city is still marked with beautifully preserved sites: the Templars\u2019 Tunnel, which snakes under Ottoman-era mosques, and Turkish baths. We entered the Old City through a towering gate and followed open alleyways to the modest door of the light-filled lobby of The Efendi Hotel.\nThe Efendi\u2019s story is one of faith and perseverance. The owner \u2013 eminent Israeli chef Uri Jeremias, also known as Uri Buri \u2013 likes to say that when he first bought these two old Ottoman-era buildings in 2003 with several \u201csilent partners\u201d, everyone thought he was crazy. Now it\u2019s one of the most elegant, original boutique hotels in the country. My room was a high-ceilinged space with a mirrored chandelier and a deep enamelled cast-iron bathtub. The public spaces feature beautifully lit reading nooks under massive arched windows and elaborate paintings on the ceilings.\nThat night I dined with Jeremias and his friend Efraim Lev, a medieval Arabic pharmacology and medicine professor, with whom Jeremias sometimes creates historical tours based on stories of the Crusaders. Several small plates of food arrived at the table: dried watermelon rolled with basil, an explosion of vinegary sweetness; a zingy ceviche with capers, lemon and olive oil.\nIt\u2019s individuals like Matta and Jeremias who can, and who wish to, quietly colour the narrative for a visitor like me \u2013 even if (perhaps especially) just over a shared meal. We finished that evening with kanafeh, a traditional Arabic dessert of thin, shredded pastry soaked in a sugary syrup and served with cardamom and rose ice cream, its piquant contrasting flavours as ancient and memorable as the place itself."

By their own",
        "output": "description on the questionnaire, six are Anglo, five Latino, and one African American.\nIn terms of background for understanding the complex medical information, Juror 10 may be the best qualified. She got a Bachelor's degree in Biochemistry in England and worked for awhile as a lab technician. She moved to the San Gabriel Valley a 12 years ago. Her husband also has a science background and works in engineering. Juror 3 has an MBA and only two of the jurors do not have at least some college work.\nJurors will return Monday at 8:30 a.m.\nHow long will it take them to finish? That's anyone's guess. Gerry Schwartz, who was in the pool of prospective Murray jurors, says the group may want a few more days in the spotlight.\n\"They're finally in a position of power, where everyone is waiting for them to give the word,\" says Schwartz. \"I think psychologically, you're going to enjoy that a little bit.\"\nThe six-week trial combined emotional testimony, including recordings of Murray and the King of Pop, and detailed scientific analysis from medical experts. Attorneys relied on both Thursday during closing arguments.\n\"Every single doctor that testified in this case said would never do what Conrad Murray did,\" Deputy District Attorney David Walgren told jurors.\nBut defense attorneys insisted that the pop superstar was responsible for his own death. They claimed Jackson created a \"perfect storm\" of drugs inside his body that led to his death on June 25, 2009.\n\"At what point to we draw the line about Dr. Murray's responsibility for a grown-up,\" defense attorney Ed Chernoff said during closing arguments.\nThe jury is considering the attorneys' arguments and testimony from nearly 50 witnesses. Deliberations began at about 8:30 a.m. Friday in a downtown Los Angeles courthouse.\nOutside the courthouse, crowds of Jackson and Murray supporters gathered in ancticipation of a verdict.\n\"We would like to get justice for Michael,\" said Jackson admirer, Felesha Wilson.\n\"I am most concerned and thankful that we do have a jury so that we can get answers to our many questions,\" said Murray supporter Beatrice Fakhrian. \" And, I believe that Dr. Murray will be exonerated.\"\nMurray was seen earlier this week walking with his girlfriend, who was a prosecution witness, along the beach in Santa Monica. When asked whether he was looking forward to putting the trial behind him, Murray said, \"I can't wait buddy.\"\nThe final days of testimony focused on science -- two experts on the drug blamed in Jackson's death took the stand -- but Walgren repeatedly mentioned Jackson and his children during his closing argument. He told the jury that even when Murray's trial is over, Prince, Blanket and Paris will continue to live with the result of Murray's mistakes.\n\"It is abundantly clear that Conrad Murray acted with criminal negligence, that Conrad Murray caused the death of Michael Jackson, and that Conrad Murray left Prince, Paris and Blanket without a father,\" Walgren said before exiting the courtroom to an ovation from Jackson fans in the hallway.\nHe also noted that what really happened on June 25, 2009, in a mansion on Carolwood Drive might never be known.\nDefense attorneys told the jury the decision comes down to whether Murray committed a crime or whether he was an unethical doctor. They portrayed Murray as an outsider who was brought into Jackson's world at time when the singer was driven to please fans with a series of upcoming London concerts.\n\"The defense raised the question, is it really apparent how Michael Jackson died?\" said NBC4 legal analyst Royal Oakes.\nIt was after a rehearsal for those concerts -- organizers originally planned about 30, but upped the numbers to 50 after pre-sale demand for tickets -- that Jackson returned to his rented Holmby Hills mansion. During the early hours of June 25, 2009, Jackson pleaded for something to help him sleep, Murray told investigators.\n\"He tried to close his eyes, and nothing would work,\" Murray said during the two-hour interview granted two days after the entertainer's death. \"He complained that he would have to cancel rehearsals... and not satisfy his fans if not rested well.\"\nMurray administered propofol, a powerful surgical sedative that Murray said Jackson called his \"milk,\" later that morning, he told investigators. He then left the room to use the bathroom and noticed Jackson wasn't breathing when he returned, Murray said.\nProsecutors claim that Murray's decision to administer propofol, usually reserved for use in a surgical setting with proper medical equipment, as a sleep aid in Jackson's bedroom was just one of the many mistakes that led to the King of Pop's death. That he left the bedroom, even for a few minutes, was another violation of the \"sacred trust\" Jackson had with his doctor, prosecutors said.\nBut the defense told jurors it was Jackson who administered the fatal dose. They also claimed Murray did not know Jackson ingested the drug lorazepam. Prosecutors and their witnesses developed stories over time that placed the blame on Murray, the defense argued.\n\"They want you to convict Dr. Murray for the actions of Michael Jackson,'' Chernoff said.\nEven if the defense's self-administration theory is correct, prosecutors said the jury should still convict Murray because of negligence. Murray's use of propofol as a sleep aid, his delay in calling 911 and failing to tell paramedics and ER doctors he administered propofol were just some of his \"bizarre\" actions, Walgren said.\n\"Poor Conrad Murray,'' Walgren said in his closing argument. \"Michael Jackson is dead. And we have to hear about poor Conrad Murray and no doctor knows what it's like to be in his shoes.\"\nMurray faces up to four years in prison and loss of his medical license if convicted. Judge Michael Pastor will determine the sentence."

        "output": "view proper pruning.\nPruning is a vital part of gardening. But, people often do not want to prune trees and shrubs because they are afraid of possibly killing or seriously harming what they are working on. With some knowledge about the act of pruning, however, you should be able to be successful in your endeavors.\nWhen you prune deciduous plants in the winter, it promotes fast regrowth in the spring. This is because most plants are dormant during the winter and since the foliage is pretty much gone, you can see the shape of the deciduous plants including the crossing and rubbing of branches-- and you can prune with confidence.\n1. Prune on a mild, dry day.\n2. First prune (cut) dead, diseased and injured branches.\n3. Remove overgrown and smaller branches to create light and air at the tree\u2019s crown.\n4. Keep the branches that maintain the structure of the trees.\n5. Finally, where on the branch do you cut? Cut branches at the node, the point at which one branch or twig attaches to another. Or, cut branches right above the branch collar\u2014the juncture of limb and tree.\n1. For shrubs that flower after May 15, it is fine to prune in winter or early spring.\n2. But, if it flowers before May 15, like forsynthia, quince and azaleas, prune as soon as the plant finishes flowering.\n3. Let the shrub keep its natural shape as you prune and for best bloom production, do not cut into a box or a ball or rounded shape.\n4. Flowering trees follow the same rules as flowering shrubs. Examples are crepe myrtles that you can prune in late winter and dogwoods and redbuds that are taken care of after they flower in the spring.\nIn general, broadleaf evergreens such as hollies and boxwoods don\u2019t require much pruning, so a light pruning with a sharp pair of shears in spring before new growth begins and then again in summer works best. Pine needle type evergreens like pine or spruce should only be pruned to remove diseased/damaged wood and that can be done any time of the year except if temperatures are below zero. I doubt though that you would be out there in that circumstance.\nIf you want to learn more about our club, Garden Club R.F.D., that normally meets at the Little Red School House across from Thompson Middle School in Middletown, on the third Tuesday of each month; or about this program at Deep Cut Gardens, call Linda at 732-681-9189."

Such a diet also can help in \"reducing or reversing\" obesity, high cholesterol, diabetes, and high blood pressure \u2013 all considered risk factors for heart disease.\nSpecifically, the recommendations advise high consumption of fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, whole grains and \"lean vegetable or animal protein (preferably fish).\" Plant-based and Mediterranean diets, which embrace this type of pattern, are singled out in the guidelines.\nThe Mediterranean diet is not actually one specific diet but a reflection of the eating habits common in the numerous countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea. It shares many characteristics with the diet known as DASH, or Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, frequently prescribed to help lower blood pressure.\nBoth plans emphasize fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, and nuts. But the Mediterranean diet includes regular use of olive oil, low to moderate intake of fish and poultry, and rare consumption of red meat and dairy products. The DASH diet allows more protein sources from low-fat dairy and cuts of meat and poultry.\nBoth diets avoid food high in saturated and trans fat, which the guidelines also discourage.\n\"I always tell patients, healthy diets \u2013 whether Mediterranean or DASH \u2013 they're all more alike than they are different,\" said Khera, a professor of medicine and director of the preventive cardiology program at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.\nKhera noted the previous prevention guidelines restricted dietary approaches to focus on lowering blood pressure and cholesterol levels. The new update provides a more comprehensive approach to making heart-healthy choices to lower overall cardiovascular risk.\nThe guidelines also recommend limiting processed meats, refined carbohydrates and all types of sweetened beverages because of their link to increased risk of death, heart disease, and stroke.\nThe guidelines' authors also note certain diets popular in recent years, including variations of a low-carb, high-fat/high-protein theme, have been linked to early death in various studies.\nDr. Kim Williams, another member of the guideline writing committee, said these fad diets, including the ketogenic diet, gain traction because they often yield dramatic results.\n\"What you're looking at, unfortunately, is short-term outcome, and weight does go down,\" said Williams, cardiology chief at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. \"When you have dramatic weight loss, your diabetes will get better or even normalize. Blood pressure will go down as well. Cholesterol? Not so much.\"\nBut he said on the extreme opposite end of the spectrum, some vegans who shun meat, dairy and other animal-based products are not making heart-smart selections if they load their plates full of fried foods or refined carbohydrates such as white bread, pasta and white rice.\nWhen it comes to preventing disease, stick with what has shown to work, Williams advised.\n\"I tell my patients, of all the data we have, if you pile it all together, you're going to do better with plant-based nutrition,\" he said.\nHigh consumption of fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, whole grains, and \"lean vegetable or animal protein (preferably fish)\" are emphasized in new diet guidelines by the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology."

Reassessing concrete surroundings leads to skepticism about the prescribed conventions of growing up. For Matt Berry, San Ramon native and",
        "output": "twenty-year-old bandleader of Happy Diving, skateboarding pivoted him away from suburban malaise and toward the Big World.\nThe title of Happy Diving's confident debut \u2014 Big World \u2014 is scrawled beneath a black-and-white photo of some goofy-spooky silhouettes. It's in quotation marks, emphasizing the ambiguity: Is \"Big World\" ironic grandstanding, youthful naivety, or a hopeful prediction?\nThe music has all three qualities. Torrents of feedback get sharpened into mightily indulgent guitar leads and copious solos, which Berry casually described as \"dumb\" and \"masturbatory.\" In these guitar-weary times, displaying proficiency is likely to attract such slights. Preempting them forces the question of whether the guitar playing on canonical records by Dinosaur Jr. is \"masturbatory.\" Basically, it is. In the context of balanced songwriting, it's also wonderful. For Happy Diving, owning showy guitar playing makes it elevated and dignified.\nHappy Diving's similarity to Dinosaur Jr. threatens to engulf the whole project. It doesn't, however, because impeccably executed homage has its own charm. Big World's strength also lies in its production. The low-end feels guttural, the sweltering guitar noise is intoxicating, and a deliberate recording error lends it a sense of constant inflation.\nJack Shirley, who recorded Big World, said that Happy Diving requested what recording engineers call \"pumping and breathing.\" Extreme compression and distortion can exacerbate the punchy low-end of a recording, but it also causes drop-outs and inconsistency in the high range. Most engineers consider it a mistake and others employ it sparingly, but Happy Diving insisted on it for the entire album. The perpetually swelling effect evokes a band growing out of its own style. Likewise, it evokes the restlessness of Berry's teen epoch.\nRecently, Berry walked in to 1-2-3-4 Go! Records, where Happy Diving's record release show will occur next Wednesday. He had no money because he didn't bring a wallet (it would've fallen through the holes in his pockets). He idly looked at records, lamented their cost, and noted personal connections.\n\"When I was eighteen, I got into Dinosaur Jr., Built to Spill, and Pavement,\" he said. A detached tone made it seem like that was more than two years ago. All of Berry's reflections were like that, every distinct period of his teens chopped into tiny increments of a year or a grade. He made high school seem like a lifetime of reinvention.\nBerry grew up in a religious household in San Ramon. For Christmas when he was twelve, Berry received a beat-making computer program and commandeered his brother's present, a toy keyboard with a microphone attached. He picked up a guitar around this time as well, and attended youth group and Christian metalcore concerts.\n\"Looking back, they were so bad, but twelve-year-old me was all about it,\" he said. Then, he rejected the faith-based music scene. \"It actually put a bad taste in my mouth for guitar music.\"\nSkateboarding dominated the next phase. He mostly sought out music to complement the activity and made \"dumb electro\" on his computer to amuse friends. Through skateboarding, he also rediscovered rock. \"Dinosaur Jr. was the reason I started playing guitar again,\" he said. \"I saw this skate video called Mind Field and it had three of their songs.\"\n\"I wrote [Big World's] songs when I was nineteen and twenty,\" Berry said. \"In that time, I became involved with a music scene, met all of these people, and my world sort of blew up.\" Indeed, Happy Diving shared bills with Wild Moth, played with Molina earlier this year at South by Southwest, and recently toured the West Coast. Jessi Frick, whose Father/Daughter record label is releasing Big World, noted a budding regional trend: Guitar-centric, 1990s-indebted rock bands from the Bay Area are beginning to reach broader audiences.\nBerry still lives with his family in San Ramon and works at the local movie theater. He still skates, but with more caution. Pain tends to linger for longer than when he was in high school. \"My friends and I were just talking about the skate park closing,\" he said. \"Without that place to hang out, it's like a certain kind of San Ramon teen won't exist anymore.\"\nThat's probably not true. San Ramon's restless teens will just entrench themselves elsewhere and \u2014 after what feels to them like an eternity \u2014 quickly won't be teens anymore and the world will open up. \"It's the suburbs and it's awful,\" Berry said. \"Happy Diving is my ticket out in a way.\"\nA day in the life of Toner's Samuelito Cruz, West End punk writing downcast pop."

A link to the survey was also posted on Facebook. District staff acknowledged that the survey could be taken multiple times from the same computer.\n-Of the 2,228 school district employees who responded, 57 percent said they oppose the program, while 36 percent said they support it and 7 percent said they were not sure.\n-Of the 1,195 teachers who took the survey, 59 percent said they oppose the program, while 34 percent said they support it.\n-Of the 281 students who took the survey, 72 percent said they oppose the program, while 28 percent said they support it.\n-Of the 9,750 parents who took the survey, 50 percent said they support the program, 47 percent they oppose it and 3 percent said they were not sure. However, the school district also filtered results to eliminate duplicate responses. By that calculation of 6,960 respondents, 56 percent of parents said they support the program, 40 percent said they oppose it and 4 percent were not sure.\n-Overall, of the 12,385 community members who took the survey, 47 percent said they support the program, 49 percent said they oppose it and 4 percent were not sure.\nSome residents have complained that the survey is not reliable because it was shared on Facebook pages where anyone could access it, and users could take the survey multiple times if they wanted to.\n\"Again, this was not a scientific, random-sample survey. It was a questionnaire sent to about 71,000 BPS staff and households over 10 days to give the highest possible number of stakeholders a voice on this issue,\" district spokesman Matt Reed said in an email. \"BPS took several steps to monitor and test our results and have only shared findings in which we have confidence.\"\nIn his analysis of the survey findings, Reed pointed out that support for the S.T.O.M.P. proposal is strongest in the northern parts of the county, where 61 percent of residents support the program. However, support is weakest in the south beaches and southeast mainland, where 60 percent of resident oppose the program.\nA previous poll by the school district asked employees if they would be willing to volunteer for the program. Out of the 700 non-teacher employees who took the survey, 267 said they were willing to volunteer as marshals. About nine percent of the respondents said they have previously worked in law enforcement or in the military.\nSchool employees who volunteer for S.T.O.M.P. would go through 176 hours of training with the Brevard Sheriff's Office and have to pass psychological screenings, background checks, drug tests and interviews. They would be armed and allowed to carry a gun at school. Their identities would be known by school administrators and first-responders but not by parents or students. Teachers would not be eligible for the program.\nThe program was devised by Brevard Sheriff Wayne Ivey, however, Ivey has since recommended the school board table the program and focus on hiring school resource officers.\nA new law put in place after the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland in which 17 people were killed requires either an SRO, school marshal or private security personnel at every school by the start of the upcoming school year.\nThe School Board is set to decide whether to adopt the program at its meeting Tuesday night and will also discuss another option to hire full-time School Safety and Security Specialists, who would undergo the same training under the S.T.O.M.P. but whose identities would be known to the public."

The six women will grace the cover of the next issue of Variety, which hits newsstands in mid-April.\nChelsea Clinton is getting swept up in a shiny ball of glitzy, self-congratulatory Hollywood/New York feel-goodery, while Ivanka Trump tries to morph into Hillary Clinton circa 1993. It\u2019s a through-the-looking-glass moment, and there is every indication that things are only going to get weirder.\nTake Ivanka\u2019s burgeoning role in her dad\u2019s administration. Already, she\u2019s sitting in on high-level meetings with world leaders, Cabinet secretaries, and business muckety-mucks. She\u2019s offering policy advice. She keeps talking with people about her child-care plan as though it\u2019s actually going somewhere in this congressional atmosphere, and she has expressed a desire to tackle other issues dealing with women in the workplace.\nTo clarify, Ivanka\u2019s is not a formal advisory position. That would require her to follow certain protocols and abide by certain ethics rules. But do not fret; Gorelick insists that Ivanka will voluntarily abide by all the same rules that apply to ordinary government officials. Not that anyone should be surprised. The entire Trump family clearly prefers to keep these things more freewheeling. Ethics guidelines can be so limiting, so intrusive, so common.\nThat makes sense. Thus far, Chelsea\u2019s greatest accomplishment is surviving her eternally needy parents\u2019 raging ambition while making solid use of the near-countless advantages their wealth and power have conferred upon her. To be fair, this puts her way ahead of many celebrity offspring. But it\u2019s not like she\u2019s got her own office in the West Wing or anything like that.\nAnd so the bizarreness of this political season grinds on, reaching down a generation to shuffle the public\u2019s expectations about even Chelsea and Ivanka. At this rate, Chelsea will soon roll out her new eponymous line of fragrances while Ivanka is announced as her dad\u2019s new chief of staff."

Even his first name",
        "output": "was unforgettable. Park is a common name in Korea, and readers who knew him only from his books often assumed that he was part Korean. In fact it was the surname of his father\u2019s best friend, which he preferred to his other given names, Leonard Hobart.\nPark was born in Utica, New York. His father, William, a surgeon who commanded a military field hospital in the first world war, was much older than his mother, Annette (nee Neudecker), and died when Park was seven. Saving his mother tuition fees, Park won a scholarship to Deep Springs, an unconventional college in the Californian desert which prepared a select group of students for life with a combination of academic courses and hard manual work. From there he won another scholarship to Chicago University, which he left with a master\u2019s, and ambitions to be a writer.\nIn New York, he met Jeannette Colin, a vivacious French Fulbright scholar, and they married in 1952. But he was soon in danger of being sent to prison when the Draft Board rejected his claim to be a conscientious objector, while Jeannette was in France with their young baby and likely to be refused re-entry into the US. It all ended happily, however, when Park accepted the draft in return for non-combatant status and was conveniently posted to south-western France.\nHe used the grant to which he was entitled after his military service to obtain a PhD at University College London, where as a younger postgraduate student I first met him. I was captivated by his life story, the exotic distinctiveness of his manners and speech, his prolific invention of nicknames for everyone he knew, and his gift for hyperbole in expressing likes and dislikes. The easy-going style of supervision at UCL suited him better than regimented American graduate programmes, and he found time to write prose fiction and perform in his own plays, as well as a completing a thesis on the poetry of Robert Browning.\nBack in the US, Park taught for some years at Connecticut College and later Brown University, Rhode Island, but in 1968, he returned with his family to live permanently in Britain, as lecturer, senior lecturer and eventually reader in the English department at Birmingham University, and from 1984 as professor of English and American literature at the University of Leeds.\nPark\u2019s first book was a revised version of his thesis, published by Yale in 1961 as Browning\u2019s Characters, a close analytical study of the dramatic monologues, focused on details as minute as punctuation, and for a time he applied a similar critical method to prose fiction. But when his friend William Irving, a distinguished Browning scholar, died leaving an unfinished biography of the poet and a wish that Park should complete it, he accepted the task and brought it to the UK with him. It was published as The Ring, the Book and the Poet in 1974, and it marked a radical change of direction in his work. His frustrated desire to be a published novelist found an outlet in biographical narrative, and helped him to achieve something he called \u201chistorical presentness\u201d \u2013 the effect, for the reader, of accompanying the biographical subject as she or he moves through time and space.\nSurprisingly his was the first comprehensive biography of Arnold to be written, but his next subject, Jane Austen, was a greater challenge, since there were already many biographies in existence. But Park discovered a previously unsuspected cache of Austen family papers, and in Jane Austen: Her Life (1987) explored parts of the novelist\u2019s life that other biographies had neglected: for instance, what she would have learned from her ambitious and adventurous brothers at a time of momentous historical events. This fresh look at \u201cdear Jane\u201d delighted many readers.\nBut even Park\u2019s admirers doubted the wisdom of his next choice of subject \u2013 Shakespeare, first because the Elizabethan period demands quite different research skills from those appropriate to the 19th century, and second because it was generally agreed that there was nothing new to be discovered or said about Shakespeare\u2019s sparsely documented life. Again he triumphed over the doubters by widening the focus of his study to take in all kinds of data about the social, historical, familial and topographical context of the playwright\u2019s life, from which a more rounded portrait than the received one could be inferred. Shakespeare: A Life (1998) was highly praised by well-qualified reviewers and nominated by some as their Book of the Year. The same method was successfully applied in Christopher Marlowe: Poet and Spy (2005).\nPark\u2019s last project, one he had long nourished, was a life of TS Eliot, which had become more feasible with the publication of two volumes of the poet\u2019s letters and the promise of more to come. But with poignant symmetry his distinguished career as biographer, which began with the completion of another scholar\u2019s unfinished book, ended sadly with the interruption of his own work-in-progress by mortal illness.\nJeannette died in 2009. Park is survived by his daughters, Corinna and Natasha, and a son, Matthew."

        "output": "the ways BC\u2019s hypocrisy shines: We still do not have an LGBTQ+ resource center, which is a huge slap in the face to the entire BC queer community. We have more students from the top 1 percent than we do from the bottom 60 percent, which is a disgrace given our $2.2 billion endowment and supposed support of America\u2019s poor and working class. Just last week, it was discovered that some of the braille on campus is printed onto the signs. Let me repeat that. BC braille is printed on so that you cannot feel it. What a terribly poetic metaphor. One of the only aides to the blind and visually impaired students on campus is a cheap facade, nothing more than worthless lip service (but is honestly nothing new in the long history of BC doing relatively little to accommodate people with disabilities on campus).\nI could write about this every week. Well, I practically do. Thankfully, this isn\u2019t to be yet another look-how-hypocritical-BC-is pieces, one of those unproductive columns just adding useless noise to The Heights. While it\u2019s important to continually point out BC\u2019s insincerity, the more pressing issue is finding solutions.\nHow do we change BC then? How do we recognize BC\u2019s hypocrisy and respond in turn, using our four years here to leave BC a little better than we entered?\nWell, it\u2019s not easy. BC changes slowly. Like really slowly. I\u2019ve had multiple conversations with faculty and administrators where they\u2019ve lamented how difficult it is to enact any meaningful change here given the conservative administrative climate and the incredibly restrictive bureaucracy. And while it\u2019s hard for faculty to make changes here, it\u2019s even harder for students to make a difference, especially given our fleeting time, demanding schedules, and lack of experience.\nSometimes it can feel hopeless at BC, that the common-sense reforms we want like an LGBTQ+ resource center are too \u201cprogressive\u201d for this place. We shouldn\u2019t despair, though. We truly have the power to change BC into the vibrant, welcoming campus we envision.\nThe first reason why is that we\u2019re students. Sometimes I think we forget how integral we are in changing the world. Young people have always been on the forefront of social and political movements. College students were instrumental in the Civil Rights Movement, African Apartheid Divestment Movement, in Standing Rock and resisting the Keystone Pipeline, and in the Queer Liberation Movement, just to name a few. I mean, Alexander Hamilton was 21 when he helped free our country from British tyranny. Lest we forget, we are the future, and we determine what sort of world we will live in tomorrow.\nFilled with endless energy and passion, we can work tirelessly toward any cause if we put our minds to it. Just take a look at O\u2019Neill at 3 a.m. if you need proof. This cynical world of ours can break us down and turn us into tired, pessimistic adults if we let it. The internship rat race and looming student debt does its fair share toward this end. But we should never, ever forget that we are the youth of our nation, of our world, and we hold the future in our eyes and hearts. Remember our history and realize our incredible power as students.\nSecondly, we have changed this campus. BC has come a long way since its early days as an Irish Catholic boys club. In 1939 and 1940, BC acquiesced in benching its first black player against Southern schools, including in the Cotton Bowl, because he was black and it would have offended the segregated colleges we were playing. BC only allowed women into all of its programs in 1970. Throughout its entire history, BC has historically had a complex relationship with its LGBTQ+ students, offering them relatively little accommodation and recognition. Yet, despite this oppressive history, marginalized students have persisted, and among the student body, we have a more inclusive culture than ever. It is far from perfect, and there are still issues of inclusivity among us, but we have made giant strides since the days when gay students received bricks through their windows.\nThe truth is, campus activism works. It may seem like those pesky protests on O\u2019Neill Plaza are just photo-ops for #woke students\u2019 Instagrams, but they can be truly transformative events that change the campus culture, inspiring hundreds of small conversations that improve the campus one student at a time. In my three years at BC, activist groups such as Climate Justice BC and Eradicate BC Racism have gone from being radical fringe groups to central parts of campus culture, focal points of social justice and student involvement. More students are organizing each day, putting in countless hours in addition to the intense work load of classes and extracurriculars to ensure that each and every student is welcome here.\nThe UGBC presidency of Akosua Achampong and Tt King is the epitome of this diametric shift and a symbol of the hope to come, the hope of a better BC that represents all students. Untold numbers of brave student activists have paved the way for this reality, opening BC up enough to elect the first all-woman executive team composed of a black woman and a lesbian. We need to work to ensure that this trend continues and that the BC of tomorrow is even more inclusive, engaged, and truly ready to set the world aflame.\nWe still have a long way to go before all of the braille on campus is more than just facade, before we have more students from the bottom 60 percent, before LGBTQ+ students feel truly welcome. But if we keep organizing, BC\u2019s culture will continue to change, bringing about Achampong\u2019s and King\u2019s, more CJBC\u2019s and Eradicate\u2019s, more \u201cmen and women for others.\u201d Then, maybe, just maybe, BC\u2019s insanely slow bureaucracy might just catch up to us."

        "output": "White House in 1996?\nRoss Perot was a major factor the last time around, after all. His backers are now holding meetings around the country to measure interest in another third-party try. Committees to draft retired Joint Chiefs chairman Colin Powell -- enormously popular in national polls -- into an independent bid have also sprung up.\nMr. Perot didn't exactly have a wonderful time the last time he ran, however, and he may just be coyly acting the kingmaker. General Powell could be a formidable political presence, but his spokesman has indicated that the presidency is not something he has aspired to, and at this point an independent race on his part would be an enormous logistical challenge.\n''It's a huge amount of work, and time's a'wasting,'' notes Susan Estrich, a University of Southern California law professor who managed Michael Dukakis's campaign in 1988.\nA third party bid in '96 would likely be fueled by the same attitude that moved Perot voters in 1992: seething discontent.\nAccording to a just-released bipartisan poll, voters' continued frustration and cynicism is shown by the fact that 23 percent still trust neither party.\nThis disenchantment is particularly strong in the south-central and Rocky Mountain states, notes the poll, which was conducted by the Tarrance Group, a GOP firm, and Democratic pollster Celinda Lake. Self-described Democrats tend to be among the most disenchanted.\n''Voters remain frustrated with Congress and angry with politicans of both parties, and their loyalties are shallow,'' concludes the poll.\nConventional political wisdom holds that last time around, Perot's candidacy helped send George Bush down to defeat by attracting Republicans in disproportionate numbers. This belief has driven GOP leaders to try and publicly discourage Perot from making another run.\nLast week House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R) of Georgia said in a broadcast interview that ''the only person helped by a third party is President Clinton and the liberal Democrats.'' He was responding, in particular, to reports that the grassroots group founded by Perot, United We Stand America, has been holding meetings around the country to poll members on another third party run.\nThe group's director Russell Verney hit back at what he called GOP ''fear tactics.'' There are indications that a Perot bid might be a wash, in terms of drawing votes away from the major parties.\nAccording to the Tarrance-Lake poll, adding Perot to a match-up between President Clinton and GOP frontrunner Sen. Bob Dole ''does little to change the equation.'' Clinton and Dole both drop 2 to 3 points, with Dole winning, 42 to 40 percent. Perot, in this poll, draws 11 percent of the voters.\nPoll numbers this far in advance of the election may be only a general indication of trends. Many experts continue to believe that Perot, if he runs, would once again siphon primarily from the GOP.\nPressure from the media obviously irritated Perot in 1988, and he may not be willing to undergo such scrutiny again. He could be simply positioning himself to throw his still-considerable support to whichever party courts him the hardest. But there's little question he remains attractive to a large slice of the voting public.\n''What happens if there's a third party? There's a great celebration at the White House, unless Colin Powell is at the head of it,'' says Stephen Wayne, a professor of government at Georgetown University in Washington.\nPowell an unknown quantity of American politics. Ideologically ambiguous, he appeals to voters who crave to have confidence in government again, Wayne says.\nPERHAPS the most tantalizing political statement Powell has made came earlier this month in a talk at a Massachusetts college: ''I've checked the Constitution very carefully and you do not have to belong to a political party'' to run for president.\nHowever, USA Today on Thursday said that Powell recently met with Republican Senator Dole and agreed to be Dole's foreign policy advisor. Republicans have long coveted Powell as a vice-presidential candidate for their '96 ticket.\nThe harsh scrutiny of the media and loss of military-like control over his daily life would be only part of Powell's problem. If he ran outside the structure of the major political parties, Powell would have to raise tens of millions of dollars on his own.\nLacking the institutional structure of the Democrats, Republicans, and even United We Stand America, the retired general would have to cobble together a semblance of a political organization.\n''To run for president, you not only have to have a thick skin, you almost have to have been planning to do it all your life,'' professor Estrich says."

It might even raise their risk of dying early of certain things, like cancer.\nThe disappointing findings come from an extensive, randomized, and",
        "output": "controlled study that first began in 2010, known as the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) trial.\nOver the next four years, nearly 20,000 people mostly over the age of 70 in both the U.S. and Australia were recruited for the trial. Black and Hispanic volunteers between 65 and 70 were included as well, since these groups have a higher risk of heart disease and dementia. All of the volunteers had no history of cardiovascular disease, dementia, or other major health problems. Half of them were asked to take 100 milligrams of aspirin a day, while the other half took a placebo.\nThe trial was scheduled to conclude at the end of 2017, but it was ended six months early, in June, because the results were already clear. After a median length of 4.7 years, the team found, people who took aspirin were just as likely to die than those who took a placebo. Specifically, 9.7 percent of the aspirin group had died of any cause, compared to 9.5 percent of the placebo group.\nOther studies have long shown that aspirin use can help prevent heart attacks and stroke in people who already have heart disease. But there\u2019s been a more contentious debate about whether preventative aspirin could help relatively healthy people avoid heart problems.\n\u201cThis study shows why it is so important to conduct this type of research, so that we can gain a fuller picture of aspirin\u2019s benefits and risks among healthy older persons,\u201d Richard Hodes, director of the National Institute of Aging, which helped fund the trial, said in a statement.\nThe lack of any positive benefit wasn\u2019t the only major finding from the ASPREE trial. Aspirin is known to increase the risk of bleeding. And in a separate paper, the authors reported that people who took daily aspirin were more likely to have an episode of major bleeding: 3.8 percent of aspirin-takers had a major hemorrhage, compared to 2.8 percent of people on placebo.\nBut less expected was the effect the drug seemed to have on cancer death rates. In a third paper, they reported that 3.1 percent of people died from cancer in the aspirin group, compared to 2.3 percent of people in the placebo group. These extra cancer deaths explained the slightly higher mortality rate seen overall in the aspirin group.\nAt this point, though, it\u2019s unclear whether this finding actually means something. There were fewer than 600 cancer-related deaths in total, with only 66 deaths separating the two groups. So it\u2019s possible the results could be chance. It also flies in the face of other major research showing that aspirin can prevent cancer, particularly in the colon and gut.\n\u201cAnalysis of all the cancer-related data from the trial is under way and until we have additional data, these findings should be interpreted with caution,\u201d said Leslie Ford, associate director for clinical research at the National Cancer Institute\u2019s Division of Cancer Prevention.\nThe ASPREE trial is unlikely to be the final word on whether preventative aspirin is worthwhile. Aspirin might still help some middle-aged people younger than 65, or it could have longer-reaching benefits for the elderly that would take more years to pay off, such as preventing dementia (in the current study, though, there was no difference in the dementia rate).\nThey plan to continue analyzing data from the ASPREE trial, and hope to keep track of their volunteers in the years to come."

Maybe not.\nFORTUNE -- Now that Japan has been knocked out by China as the world's second-biggest economy, the next question is: When will it dominate the U.S.? The Asian powerhouse could unseat the U.S. from the top spot as early as 2030, experts say, reconfirming",
        "output": "China's growing influence on economies in every corner of the globe.\nBut a lot could happen over the next 20 years. Japan has been the world's second-largest economy for most of the past four decades. At one point, there was even speculation that Japan would eventually unseat the United States -- in the 1980s, Japan edged very close, but not close enough.\nBut unlike Japan, which has an older, smaller population and an economy that saw lackluster growth for more than a decade, China has plenty more room to grow. Its potential lies in the fact that about one-fifth of the world lives there and virtually every major company looking to increase market share, from General Electric (GE, Fortune 500) to Caterpillar (CAT, Fortune 500), has a strategy to somehow reach those consumers.\nBut what does it really mean for China to be the No. 2 economy in the world, let alone the No. 1? And what could practically stand in the way of China eventually becoming the world's biggest economy?\nFor one, says Nicholas Lardy, senior fellow with the Peter G. Peterson Institute for International Economics, China's demographics are vastly changing, potentially constraining its supply of workers. Although its population is about four to five times bigger than the U.S., its prime working age population of 20 to 35 year-olds is beginning to shrink as the country continues enforcing its policy limiting couples to one child. What's more, the vast majority of the population living in rural areas is either very old or very young. The huge cost of growth is predicted to only continue to go up as demand rises for everything from cleaner air and water.\nThe fact that China's economy is driven so heavily on investments and exports will eventually catch up with the country's leaders sooner rather than later. While China's exports have remained strong amid uncertainties of the global economy -- in July, exports rose 38.1% to $145.5 billion, and the trade surplus with the U.S. widened by 46% to $28.7 billion -- demand for Chinese goods will likely drop off considerably with lackluster U.S. growth and debt problems in parts of Europe.\nAnd if we look at the value of China's GDP, it's clear that the country isn't necessarily richer. It's just a lot bigger. For the three months ending in June, Japan's economy was valued at $1.29 trillion. China came in higher at $1.34 trillion. But they are still dwarfed by the U.S. economy, which had a GDP of $3.5 during the same period.\nYet citizens of the U.S. and Japan are still the richest in the world. America boasted an income per capita of $42,240 last year, while Japan came close at $37,800. For its size, China has made incredible strides in raising individual incomes, but it lags far behind at nearly $3,600. Even if China trumps the U.S. economy in the next two decades, income per capita will definitely still trail behind.\nThis is not to downplay China's progress or its huge rising global influence. China reaches far, wide and, in some cases, deep into many places and many sectors. Parts of Africa and Latin America, including Colombia and Peru, have seen commodity prices surge on demand from China for its natural resources. Even developed nations, such as Australia and Canada, have seen steady growth from China's appetite for everything from coal to oil. It also holds huge amounts of foreign reserves and a large chunk of U.S. debt.\nThe International Monetary Fund predicts China will grow steadily in the foreseeable future -- 10.5% in 2010 and 9.6% in 2011. The great debate (if only other nations were so lucky) is whether it will continue to grow at around 10% or will it drift down to 8%.\nWhether or not China surpasses the U.S. economy may not be the point of the country's extraordinary growth story. Indeed, milestones are memorable, but how China grows will be the far bigger story than who it overtakes.\nUpdate: An earlier version of this story incorrectly compared the U.S.'s 2009 GDP of $14.6 trillion with the GDP of China and Japan during the second quarter. The correct comparison is with the U.S.'s second-quarter GDP of $3.5 trillion."

The anguished reaction to the article\u2014\u201dI just want to throw up,\u201d proclaimed conservative commentator Michelle Malkin on Fox News\u2014 taps a deep vein of revulsion in American culture toward the possibility that mass murder can in any way be explainable. It feels distasteful and outrageous to seek \u201canswers\u201d to something as awful as mass terror. But to understand the terror is not to forgive or forget it.\nWhen we distance ourselves from our shared humanity and treat mass murderers as removed from our daily lives, we don\u2019t have to examine the more prosaic factors that can contribute to the violence in our midst: bad genes, child neglect, untreated mental illness, too-easy access to assault weapons, political and religious indoctrination, and the like. Of course, the great majority of people in depressing circumstances do not become a mass murderer, but few mass murderers don\u2019t have a laundry list of extenuating circumstances or grievances. We can abhor them, but we can\u2019t completely ignore them.\nSome have suggested that the Rolling Stone editors simply wanted to boost sales. This misses the point. The cover photo, a self-portrait that had actually been in circulation for months, strikes a nerve precisely because there was no trick, no deception to either white-wash or glorify the murders. On the contrary, the story was written to reveal, not conceal, the true nightmare of April 15th. Normalcy is part of the story of the Boston Marathon bombers; we can\u2019t run away from that. Dzhokhar was a young man who took pictures of himself, just like millions of teenagers. There was some genuine goodness in his heart, according to reasonable people who knew him best, and he experienced pain and trauma in his young life too. Acknowledging these facts doesn\u2019t automatically label a person a love struck \u2018fan\u2019 or a disgrace to humanity.\nIt shouldn\u2019t be un-American to confront these issues, and defacto censorship \u2013 which is what companies like CVS are doing by refusing to sell the issue \u2013 is actually disrespectful to the victims and their families. To push the story away is to say that we are unwilling, as a society, to cope with difficult questions. It\u2019s an admission that we are simply afraid to know too much, afraid, literally, to see too much. It\u2019s a public declaration that we can deal with a demon like Osama Bin Laden, whose middle aged, sickly face was plastered on magazine covers for years, because he wasn\u2019t actually \u2018one of us.\u2019 But to chronicle the life of a homegrown kid, buffeted by parental abandonment, financial debt, increasing cultural isolation and despair? That cuts close to the bone.\nThat\u2019s a hard comparison to stomach if you are a Bostonian, but we need to get over our nausea. We can\u2019t wipe out terror by removing magazines that might offend us from our shelves. Many of the post-9/11 terrorist plots and attacks have been planned and executed by citizens of Western countries on Western soil. This is our reality and probably our future, too. Stories like Dzhokhar\u2019s can give us powerful insights into the mind of these disaffected young people straddling two very different identities and ways of life. We should read as much as we can about them."

It also made the house more accessible for the homeowners as they age.\nAfter she removed the lawn and installed a barrier and pea gravel, Tandy created a flagstone pathway and softened it with creeping thyme ground cover, lavender, dwarf sweat peas and Chinese sedum.\nDrought-tolerant flowering cherry trees add texture and give the garden a pop of color against the home's gray palette. So do flowering plums along the side of the yard, blueberry bushes close to the house, pretty purple Mexican sage and Chinese fringe, all of which require little water.\n\"It's all about plant selection and color palette,\" says Tandy. \"We kept to a green palette, not an arid-looking palette.\"\nTandy estimates the project cost about $15,000, and the homeowners received a $5,000 turf removal rebate. (Note: The Metropolitan Water District closed the program to new applications in July 2015 after money was fully allocated).\nThis price tag included boulders, trees and hiring a stone mason to update the front porch. \"Trees can become a secondary source of the budget,\" Tandy says. \"If you're willing to wait, you can plant one gallon plants. Pinch things back as they grow; it forces them to grow fuller and more rapidly.

A significant portion of the landscape is, in fact, not planted. \"The key to drought-tolerant landscaping is to mix your plantings with the right amount of hardscaping and permeable hardscaping,\" Tandy says. \"Anyone can do it.

The hit on revenue from ZTE of about $25 million to $30 million was included in the guidance, Chief Executive Officer Liam Griffin said on a conference call with analysts. The United States in April banned American firms from selling parts and software to Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE Corp for seven years for violating the sanctions against Iran.\nSkyworks said it expects third-quarter revenue in the range of $875 million to $900 million, while analysts were expecting $931.8 million. Analyst Kumar said the guidance was \u201creally not that bad\u201d as investors expected much worse because of soft trends at Apple. CEO Griffin said he expected meaningful sequential growth into the fourth quarter and into December following a traditional seasonal pattern for mobile and smartphones. Strong demand for chips used in network gear, connected devices and automobiles helped Skyworks top estimates for second-quarter profit and revenue. The company\u2019s net income rose to $276 million, or $1.50 per share, in the three months ended March 30 from $224.9 million, or $1.20 per share, a year earlier.\nExcluding certain items, Skyworks earned $1.64 per share, above estimates of $1.60. Revenue rose to $913.4 million from $851.7 million, beating estimate of $910.7 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares of the Woburn, Massachusetts-based company were marginally lower at $91.83 after the bell."

That\u2019s the report out of the New York Times in Michael Schmidt\u2019s piece, New Contract Will Enable Baseball to Test for H.G.H.\nAs far",
        "output": "as I\u2019m concerned, this places Major League Baseball leaps ahead of the NFL\u2019s washrag-type attitude where they can\u2019t seem to finalize their plans to test for this substance. They just can\u2019t seem to get it right yet.\nDepicted in my last piece, California Representative Henry Waxman Calls Into Question NFL Union \u201cDelay\u201d Tactics Regarding HGH Testing, I discuss the NFL\u2019s inability to have the guts to make a real commitment to testing for Human Growth Hormone. Oh sure, they can come up with a plan, but follow through on it, nah, maybe next year!!!\nAnd questioning the validity of the test (the players union\u2019s reasoning for not moving forward) holds absolutely no water whatsoever. Funny how the test seems valid for the Olympics (being used at that level for almost 10 years) and for Major League Baseball. No matter that scientists are saying it\u2019s valid, the NFL players union just\u2026isn\u2019t so sure. I suppose they know something no one else does. Wonder what that is???\nSignificant as well is the reported 50-game suspension for a positive test, almost a third of the MLB season. That consequence definitely has some bite to it; however, I wonder if that comes with some financial penalty as well?\nMe, I would make the first offense half the season and include financial punitive action as well. Second time, you\u2019re done as a professional baseball player. Everything (possible fame, fortune, lifestyle, etc.) gone!!!\nI commend baseball on its move forward and hope they continue to press hard against cheats. The NFL, well, let\u2019s just keep an eye on them and see how all this plays out.\nTechnically it is illegal, because in the MLB if you use steroids, and you are found you can actually be brought before a federal court. Remember Mark McGuire? Congress held hearings on his steroid use at the time. So that tells me it is illegal and of course it is a banned substance. So I think testing the players (from the official standpoint) is only being done to abide by the various laws and regulations in place. Also there is the fact that the players should not have an added advantage which is cheating if it gives you a leg up on the competition.\nAs far as the players go, I can see what they are referring to. The players don't want to be tested because many players don't use HGH. Think of it this way. If you were a player, and you were demanded to be tested, and you were not using or abusing illegal substances, then you would most likely feel violated. Why? Simply because its not fair to you, to be tested for something you haven't done. Its like being tested for a disease. Why do it, if you know that you don't have a family history of a certian disease? The players have valid points here. I think many feel it is a breach of their privacy, and I many don't want to take the fall for a few players who are making bad choices.\nThanks for the response. Yes it is illegal to use PED's, but it is also unethical. It destroys the integrity of the game, any game, and it forces those not interested in that path to have to consider it as a possibility in order to stay competitive. And let\u2019s face it, sports are competitive.\nRegarding your last point. I would not mind at all, in fact I would probably volunteer, to take a blood test for HGH or any other illegal substance. I would not feel violated in any way and understand the greater good that this would represent.\nThere are jobs where drug testing is mandatory even for those who are not using. I, as an educator, would have no problem being tested for any illegal substance, if that is what they required of me.\nPersonally, based on what is going on, I DON'T believe the players have valid points at all. I am of the opinion that they don't want to be tested because they (the ones not wanting to be tested) are concerned about getting caught and they are afraid they won't be able to compete at the level they want without HGH - or any other PED.\nLastly, again, based on what is actually going on, the message pro sports is sending to our youth with the use of PED's, the fact that it puts pressure on honest, hardworking athletes to use in order to keep up, because it enhances the chances for a level playing field, and because it is for the greater good of all, it behooves us to make PED and HGH testing in professional and elite level sports mandatory.\nThat is my 2 cents!!!"

Most of the attention went to e-commerce startups, but IT-oriented people my age and older also recall that many larger firms were attempting to embrace",
        "output": "e-commerce. While I was only on the fringes of that movement, in many cases a consultant or academic like me would be brought in to help a company strategize about this important new capability.\nIt feels like that again now, and this time the focus is on Big Data. A lot of companies are aware that Big Data and analytics offer them considerable opportunity for competitive advantage or parity. They glance sideways at Google Inc. or eBay or Facebook Inc. and say, \u201cAre they going to take over my business?\u201d They peek at GE, and say, \u201cShould I be making a similarly bold investment in data and analytics?\u201d Many organizations are now trying to familiarize their executives with the Big Data possibilities, and to develop a strategy for how to proceed with it.\nWhat kinds of activities and decisions should a company pursue as it wrestles with its Big Data strategy? I see two major decisions at first, and then several others that follow from them. I\u2019ll use Monsanto as an example, since it is a company that is clearly moving from being a provider of seeds and herbicides to one that provides data and analytics-based products and services.\nThe first two involve data and business opportunity: at their intersection lie the activities to turn data into money. Whenever I ask successful Big Data users whether they start with the data they have on hand, or the business needs that they have, they always say \u201cyes.\u201d So you need to jointly evaluate these two issues, and hope that they meet in the middle.\nThe data question involves a quick inventory of what data resources a company has on hand, and what other related, important ones it could get access to. At Monsanto, for example, the company already had lots of data on plant hybrids and their growth under various conditions; it had been accumulating that data for decades, and it was well-stored and well-understood. What the company lacked was detailed, highly granular data on soil and weather\u2014the other factors necessary for plant growth. Monsanto found a good source of field-level weather data in a Bay Area startup called The Climate Corporation. Managers bit the bullet and bought the company for $930 million last year. You might guess that if there were a similar company in the soil space, Monsanto would probably buy it too. Indeed, it did that in purchasing the soil monitoring business of Solum Inc. this past February.\nThe business need involves the key issues that a company or its customers are facing that might be addressed with data and analysis. The business need at Monsanto is to help their traditional customer\u2014large farmers\u2014become more productive. They saw the opportunity to help growers with \u201cpredictive planting\u201d\u2014the exact combination of moisture, seed, soil composition, seed depth and density, and planting and harvesting time to optimize crop yields. Agriculture has become a complex and precise business, and farmers need help with it. The strategy seems like a great idea, although it\u2019s early to know whether and how much farmers will pay for such advice.\nMany other aspects of a Big Data strategy flow from the answers to those two questions. How should you organize the resources to meet those business needs with the identified data? Monsanto felt that it would be easier and more effective to move all existing data and analytical products into the Climate Corp. organization than to try to build the new capabilities within its St. Louis headquarters. It\u2019s also probably easier to find new data scientist talent in the Bay Area. The soil composition acquisition was also moved into Climate Corp.\nThe right technologies to adopt also often flow from data and business need decisions. Perhaps not surprisingly, Monsanto felt that the volume and speed of data processing necessary to succeed would come primarily through Hadoop. One crop in one season in one country generates 20 billion data records, and yield monitoring sensors generate another 14 billion\u2014so some considerable parallel processing horsepower was necessary. Climate Corp. already had expertise in Hadoop, so continuing to use it was not a tough decision.\nThere will be many other ongoing decisions that companies like Monsanto have to make in fleshing out and executing on their Big Data strategy. But many of the key components seem to be in place. Other companies might decide to build the necessary capabilities internally rather than acquiring them, but that would take much more time.\nIt will be interesting to see how Big Data strategy decisions work out over time in comparison to e-commerce programs. I think most established companies got value from putting an e-commerce strategy in place. In e-commerce and in Big Data, the only big mistake seems to be to do nothing."

        "output": "filed Tuesday alleges.\nThe federal court suit was brought by the Michigan-based, pro-affirmative action group By Any Means Necessary. It challenges the constitutionality of Proposition 209, a ballot measure approved by California voters in 1996 that prohibited racial or gender preferences in public contracting, education and employment.\nA federal appeals court and the California Supreme Court have rebuffed earlier efforts to overturn the 13-year-old law. But Shanta Driver, the group's lead counsel, said a renewed federal challenge is timely because the U.S. Supreme Court has since issued a pair of rulings upholding some school desegregation programs. The gap between Latino and black high school graduation rates and UC enrollment has grown since Proposition 209 was enacted.\n\"Thirteen years of a ban on affirmative action in the state of California has left, in particular UCLA and Berkeley, with just pitiably low numbers of black and Latino students,\" Driver said.\nAt the heart of the complaint is the claim that minority students and their parents are being uniquely disadvantaged in violation of their due process rights because Proposition 209 prevented the university's governing Board of Regents from setting admissions policies that include race, gender and ethnicity, but not other characteristics, as factors.\n\"You can't have a white majority create a situation in which the only people who are barred from going to their regents and saying, 'Adjust the admissions system so more of our sons and daughters can get in' are black, Latino and Native American,\" Driver said.\nUC spokesman Ricardo Vasquez said university lawyers were examining the lawsuit but that it was too soon for officials to comment on it. President Mark Yudof has criticized Proposition 209 in the past.\nAccording to the suit, Latino, black and Native American students make up one-quarter of the freshmen enrolled at UC's nine undergraduate campuses this year \u2014 a higher percentage than in 1996. But because underrepresented minorities also comprise a bigger share of all public high school graduates \u2014 48 percent compared with 39 percent in 1996 \u2014 their presence at UC schools has not kept pace in the absence of affirmative action, the complaint claims.\nDriver said that while a trial judge must first decide whether to hear or dismiss the case, her aim is to get the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to take another look at Proposition 209. In 1997, a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit ruled unanimously to uphold the measure, which was passed by 54 percent of California voters.\nVoters in Washington, Michigan and Nebraska have passed laws similar to Proposition 209. A 1996 court order in Texas and a 2000 vote by the Florida Legislature banned the use of race in school admissions in those states."

        "output": "first introduction to Mini Takes The States (MTTS) 2016, a road rally that takes Mini owners (and often their dogs) across the U.S. in two weeks. The event has been scheduled every two years for the last ten, and it has grown from just 30 cars to over 700. I would be joining the herd for a stint from South Dakota to Utah \u2013 that much I knew. What I didn\u2019t know was that I\u2019d quickly be inducted into one of the most eclectic and friendly groups of people on the planet.\nSo how does MTTS work, why does it work, and who can participate?\nFrom the outside looking in, it would appear that MTTS is simply a large-scale brand building opportunity. Round up a bunch of owners, steer them across the U.S., stopping from town to town like a traveling circus, and let the on-brand conversations commence. While that\u2019s undoubtedly a brilliant side effect of the rally, it\u2019s only part of a larger story. For one, the owners have just as much or more to gain from this exercise as Mini.\nI\u2019d quickly be inducted into one of the most eclectic and friendly groups of people on the planet.\nFor a $75 registration fee, Mini provides meals, on-route events, parking, discounts, prizes, and even vehicle roadside maintenance for every car. That just leaves owners and their families with two week\u2019s worth of hotel bills \u2013 and even those aren\u2019t that pricey since Mini helps negotiate group rates. As long as you don\u2019t run into trouble with any highway patrol officers, the whole trip is quite reasonable. To put it another way, Mini pays for a big chunk of your two-week vacation. Apparently, the event is so attractive, that one couple that had signed up for the rally chose to actually buy a Mini when they found out it was a requirement to participate. Sure, forfeiting the registration fee would have been easier, but who am I to judge?\nThen there\u2019s the charitable side to MTTS. Mini has partnered with Feeding America, an organization dedicated to fighting domestic hunger. Owners are encouraged to create their own fundraising pages through Feeding America\u00ae and receive badges based on how much is raised. By the time we\u2019d hit Wyoming, Mini\u2019s troop had already earned enough to sponsor over 1,000,000 meals.\nPickups, Land Rovers, and retired tanks: I saw each of these during my leg of MTTS, but not among the ranks of registered participants. Instead, there were all generations and models of Mini vehicles, decked out in every color combination imaginable. It may be difficult to believe, but besides the cars we journalists were driving, no two Minis were alike. What the average citizen may have seen as a form of transportation, this group of owners saw as a blank slate for personal expression.\nMy personal favorites included a first generation Clubman that had been converted into a pest control-mobile, a Countryman with a color-matching caravan, and a Star Wars-themed Cooper four-door. But beyond these standouts, there were graphics-wrapped Minis, race-ready Minis, and Minis that had converted their interiors into dog habitats. While some cars made my eyes hurt, all of them were extensions of their owners\u2019 enthusiasm.\nRallying over 4,000 miles can be an absolute blast or a total nightmare \u2013 and it all depends on the company. In the case of MTTS, I didn\u2019t find an unfriendly soul in the bunch of owners who posed with one another in front of Mount Rushmore, danced together at a saloon in Sturgis, SD, and swapped stories while watching a rodeo near Cheyenne, WY. Instead, I felt awful for not being as overtly warm as each individual who approached me with a smile during every \u201crise and shine\u201d event. In my defense, the M.O. of the general populous in the two places I\u2019ve spent most of my life: Boston and LA, is to be skeptical and tough, lest you be labeled an oddball.\nBut these people had no agenda, except to welcome and befriend every Mini owner they met. When I asked why they participated in MTTS, some owners said it was a great way to see the country, but almost all of them said they did it for the friendships."

According to the Dallas Morning News, a 4.0 earthquake rattled Johnson County on Thursday, May 7. Johnson County is just south of the Dallas-Fort Worth area.\nBolstering the USGS report linking fracking to quakes are the findings of a new Southern Methodist University-led research team, which indicate that drilling in parts of Texas \u201cmost likely\u201d caused a number of earthquakes in the area over the course of recent years.\nState Column reports that SMU researchers are especially concerned that a small earthquake could lead to another, especially where fault-lines are involved. However, the Texas Railroad Commission, an organization that oversees oil and gas affairs in the state, has been hesitant to accept findings that link the fracking industry to seismic activity.\nFor his part, Texas Governor Greg Abbott appears ready to kick his state\u2019s fracking industry into overdrive when he signs a bill that will loosen restrictions on fracking companies. HB40, a bill that has been nicknamed the \u201cDenton Fracking Bill\u201d after the Texas town that voted for a complete ban on the practice within its borders, will effectively prevent Texas cities from placing any major restrictions on fracking companies. According to NBC Dallas-Fort Worth, the anticipated move was roundly condemned by Adam Briggle, President of the Denton Drilling Awareness Group.\nEver since the Mayan calendar came to its anticlimactic end a few years ago, the concept of a life-changing mega-disaster has more or less faded from the forefront of American imaginations.

Make the bar low enough to avoid eliminating anyone with some semblance of support.\nRequiring candidates who obtained, say, 3 percent of the vote in October would ensure that all candidates with at least an outside chance of success could take part in the new election.

Several studies have demonstrated that five key exercises improve bone density in the hip and spine and therefore are effective in the battle against osteoporosis. These exercises are",
        "output": "lunges, squats, chair raises, stepping and toe raises.\nThe phrase \u201cweight-bearing exercise\u201d has become an increasingly popular way to help people understand bone-building exercises, but it doesn't fully explain the type of stimulus bones need. To increase bone density, exercise must be different from and greater than daily activities. If you have been inactive and start a walking program or switch from walking to running, your bones will initially respond by improving density, but after a couple of weeks, the stimulus becomes normal and your bones no longer need to adapt. Bone density responds better to short bouts of increased mechanical loading. In other words, ongoing repetitive movements common to aerobic exercise are not effective at increasing bone density, even if they are weight-bearing activities. After the first minute or so of repetitive loading, the cellular response of bones switches off. On the other hand, lunges and squats are the kind of weight-bearing exercises that do build bone density.\nTo increase bone density, you have to surprise the skeletal system with diverse exercises that require unfamiliar loading patterns or changes in movements. Your bones will adapt to new and different forces from a variety of angles, but only the bones that are directly stressed will adapt. The two primary ways to add stress to bones are to increase force and add impact. Squats increase force by tugging on the muscles that attach to the bones. Forward, diagonal and side lunges increase force by tugging on the bones from different angles. They also add impact when you step down into the lunge.\nBoth squats and lunges are compound exercises, meaning they incorporate multiple movements and use more than one joint. Because of this, they are often difficult to perform correctly in the beginning, before your neuromuscular system is familiar with the motion. It's a good idea to have a personal trainer or physical therapist evaluate your form. Start simply and perfect your form before increasing the difficulty. To safely squat, keep your knees aligned over your ankles throughout the squat. The easiest way to do this is to squat with your calves against a chair. Squatting with your toes and knees facing forward and your feet greater than hip-width apart will increase balance during the squat, place less stress on your knees and improve strength in your hips. To lunge safely, keep the lunging knee aligned over the ankle. Lunging up onto a step will place less stress on your knees.\nOnce you can easily repeat three sets of 15 repetitions without pain, advance to more difficult variations, switch between exercises in a set and vary the tempo. You can also start adding weight in 1- to 2-pound increments. To add weight, hold dumbbells or wear a weighted belt or vest. For each new weight, start with one set of 10 to 15 repetitions and work up to three sets of 15."

For the techies, the morning shift runs from 7am to 4.30pm and the late shift runs through to 2am.\n\"My responsibility has been to monitor the fault system that generates alarms in the system. I ensure that the telephony and data systems are fully operational and I am the first point of contact if anything goes wrong,\" says Davidson. \"We are basically providing the data network for the media to use.\"\nEach network team comprises six techies and a manager. They have been drawn from Avaya sites across six continents.\n\"About two thirds of the people here are from the US and the rest have come from from all over the world.

One colleague just works on the links between the media centre and all the stadia. I have learned some valuable data networking skills, such as basic Cajun configuration and monitoring of Cajun devices.\"\nUnsurprisingly, the pressure was really on when the matches were being played. \"Suddenly there are lots of people standing behind you, but the real priority is that there are no problems,\" says Davidson.\nIt is going to be hard going back to the normal routine in Glasgow, but Davidson is hoping he will stand a good chance of being asked to cover the 2006 World Cup in Germany. \"The whole thing has been tremendous and has totally surpassed my expectations.

Isn\u2019t Trump basically saying law enforcement will be looking out for, uh, those who, you know \u2026 BREAK THE LAW?\u2019 And you\u2019d be entirely correct, but remember when it comes to liberals we aren\u2019t talking about \u201cnormal\u201d people, not on any intellectual or moral level. We\u2019re talking about people whose entire lives revolve around obtaining power, retaining power, and using that power to pound the rest of us into submission. By any means necessary. So when Trump or anyone else to the right of center talks about an issue like voter fraud, liberals don\u2019t hear \u2018law and order\u2019 or \u2018fair elections,\u2019 but instead they see it as mean-old-Trump trying to take away one of their primary tools for stealing elections.\nAnd they go absolutely ballistic.\n\u201cDonald Trump and Republicans know that they have to lie about voter fraud\u2014which is virtually nonexistent\u2014to suppress and intimidate voters in order to win,\u201d tweeted Bernie Sanders, because nobody would ever try any funny business to keep him from getting elected.\nOne cannot help but wonder if Acosta is aware that immigrants aren\u2019t allowed to vote until they become citizens.\nIt\u2019s a common theme, one that\u2019s been repeated often since Trump first raised the issue after the 2016 election, and it still begs the question - If voter fraud is so \u201cnon-existent,\u201d why are these geniuses so apoplectic that Trump is concerned about it?\nThe other tactic is to accuse Trump and others concerned about voter fraud of \u201cvoter suppression,\u201d or trying to keep minorities from voting. But by some of the below reactions, you\u2019d think Trump was planning to have hooded KKK members at polling places checking party affiliations and allowing only Republicans to enter.\n\u201cShame on you, Mr. President, for trying to intimidate voters, especially while you yourself are under investigation for the most egregious electoral fraud this nation has ever experienced,\u201d wrote former Clinton-era Labor Secretary Robert Reich.\n\u201cNormally this stuff is printed on anonymous, deniable flyers and thrust under minority voters' doors in the dead of night,\u201d wailed David Frum.\nSeriously, only Frum and his ilk would think eligible-to-vote minorities are so stupid that they would stay away from the polls simply because Trump said authorities would be making sure everyone is \u2026 eligible to vote.\nI don\u2019t know. Did Trump say citizens weren\u2019t allowed to vote? Maybe I missed that part, Bette? Of course, there\u2019s always the possibility that you and I define \u201ccitizen\u201d differently.\nBut seriously, in what universe does insisting that one must be properly and legally registered to vote in order to vote amount to \u201cvoter suppression.\u201d Sure, maybe it \u201csuppresses\u201d the votes of dead people, illegal immigrants and people who planned to \u201cvote early and often\u201d on election day, but other than that, on what level is insisting on law and order some sort of immoral act?\nIn other words, there is one logical reason and one logical reason alone why Democrats wail about voter fraud - because they know the practice exists and they expect to benefit from it. Even if the numbers aren\u2019t in the millions that Trump alleged after 2016, a few thousand or even a few hundred well placed \u201cvotes\u201d can turn the tide in key districts.\nAnd things grow even more murky when Democrats won\u2019t even allow investigations into the issue. Case in point, President Trump being forced to dissolve the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity in January because certain Blue States refused to cooperate or give the commission any data.\nMight they have something to hide?\nEven so, some instances have come to light, like here, and here and here, among others. And given the hysteria around the fact that Trump even brought it up, you can bet there are more out there if the issue could somehow achieve a full, comprehensive state-by-state investigation.\nAfter all, if our president weren\u2019t over the target, he wouldn\u2019t be getting so much flak."

Part of it is sold by the bold curves and edges, while the other part is sold by the RGB logo on the back. It\u2019s a look that is common across any gaming hardware, and it\u2019s guaranteed to turn looks towards it.

It\u2019s made in collaboration with Gamevice, and they\u2019re promising a special TV dock in the near future. Lastly, the TwinView Dock is a special clamshell controller with a screen on the bottom. That screen is also a 6\u201d 2160 x 1080 AMOLED panel, and it is accompanied with two stereo speakers. The controller also features grips and shoulder buttons, as many others do.

Last year ohio was not prepared for one half of the BTN. ohio was up for Mich. and still lost. Uban Myer coaching comes with glitches and I believe he was hired on the basis that beating Mich. is the number one goal and that may well be fine but Urban better pay attention to each and every game cause there are some darn good coaches and teams in the BTN now and I'm assured that Brady Hoke and staff will be well prepared for each game.\nMon, Apr 2, 2012 : 4:48 p.m.\nMore bad recruiting news. It appears that some on here, because I seek to keep those who follow me and seek my opinion abreast of the recruiting scene, accuse me of being an OSU sympathizer. Rather lending what I feel is my expertise knowledge of the process, helps others on Mlive understand the recruiting world and it's implications on the Michigan program. Now that my intentions are cleared up, the recruiting news I wish to inform you of has to do with another OSU commit. Another 4 star. This time a safety. We have landed high-quality big men and OSU is getting quality skill players and have yet to focus on big men.

If I was an ohio fan I'd find it very unnerving, meaning that great Wolverine football program from, &quot;up North&quot;. I just love the sound of, &quot;That team up North&quot;. It just sounds like Christmas all year.\nMon, Apr 2, 2012 : 2:17 a.m.\nThis running back information is very interesting. However, I do have some discouraging news on the recruiting front. It seems that Ohio St. has landed a 4 star running back from St. Louis. His scouting report shows that he is a big back with great top end speed.

But the quality at thier skill positions thus far has highlighted the failings of the Michigan football camp and its shortcommings when recruiting top-level RBs, WRs ect. It appears now that the RB we got from Ohio was never really up to par to start at Ohio St. Why is it that we have to settle for left-overs ?\nMon, Apr 2, 2012 : 6:25 a.m.\nSo now Michigan's now, what, only 10 spots ahead of them in the recruiting rankings?\nMon, Apr 2, 2012 : 5:10 a.m.\nSun, Apr 1, 2012 : 7:14 p.m.\nWhat a treat...getting a glimpse of Michigan football at this time of year.

This would quickly prove to be a na\u00efve assumption.\nHosted by Vancouver city officials, the meeting was the latest event",
        "output": "held in the run up to the February 17th public hearing on the rezoning of 777 Pacific Boulevard. If approved, the proposal will allow Paragon to relocate its current operations at the Edgewater into a new complex to be built on the southwest side of BC Place Stadium.\nThe Las Vegas-based Paragon recently ran an eight-page ad in the Vancouver Sun, claiming that the city of Vancouver will (hypothetically) receive $23 million per year if the plan goes ahead.\nA number of city officials were in attendance, including senior social planner Mario Lee, who told the crowd that in addition to the profits to be wrought from the proposed casino, Paragon has agreed to hire ten percent of its new workers from the Downtown Eastside.\nThis incentive was in line with the prevailing theme of the meeting \u2013 jobs. As the bulk of the crowd was pro-casino Edgewater employees, job security dominated the discussion.\nEventually it became a bit repetitive and I walked over to the food table for a coffee and while I was surveying the baked goods situation one of the Blueshirts began to deliver a rousing speech that a more cynical individual may have suspected to be something of a pre-scripted pantomime.\nThe speaker began by explaining how the new casino would attract tourists from around the world, allowing Vancouver to once again showcase its greatness on the global stage just as it did during the Olympics. Then his tone took a dour turn, arguing that the scope and size of the Edgewater was never fully realized, and without the proposed expansion, 800 hard-working people will lose their jobs and would no longer be able to support their families.\nThis prerogative is completely understandable; no one wants to lose his or her job. Nor do many of us aspire to be pariahs. But if the Edgewater was already losing money to begin with, is it in the best interest of the city of Vancouver to redefine an entire neighbourhood just to accommodate one failing business model?\nThe greater potential of Northeast False Creek was scantly mentioned, unless in reference to how amazingly entertaining and (hypothetically) profitable it will all be once home to Western Canada\u2019s largest casino.\nBut no matter which way you spin it, building a large casino in the downtown core seems like an act of desperation. Hopefully tonight\u2019s other casino-related event, Vancouver not Vegas, will produce a more lively debate that doesn\u2019t hinge on former glory and flashing lights."

He\u2019ll need it\u2019\u2019, February 2-3). Quite to the contrary, these changes would reduce fairness.\nIf an income earner pays too much PAYG tax through the year, the government refunds the excess. But if a dividend earner has paid too much tax (in the form of a reduced payment, since the company has already paid the tax), no refund would be paid. Further, if an income earner receives franked dividends, the government would refund the franking credits to them in the form of a tax deduction. But if a person has no income other than dividends, no refund would be paid.\nTeachers, hairdressers, nurses, paramedics, firefighters, aged, disability and early childcare workers are typical of those taxpayers who contribute to the yearly $5 billion cash payments for refundable franking credits. Labor believes that this largesse, provided by John Howard, is unfair and unsustainable in the future and plans to remove it.\nMeanwhile, these same taxpayers are helping to fund hundreds of thousands of dollars to Scott Morrison and senior Liberals as they tour the country, not promoting policies of their own, but predicting fire and brimstone should Labor succeed.\nIt\u2019s just as well the tree didn\u2019t fall across tram lines (\u2018\u2018Extremely lucky to be alive\u2019\u2019, Sun-Herald, February 3).\n\u2018\u2018Buses were diverted via Margaret Street, Kent Street and Erskine Street to return to York Street and were missing stops along York Street at Wynyard.\u2019\u2019 Where would the tram have gone?

Every country has an agenda and it is up to our government to remain independent despite lobbying. The media reporting is biased, sensational and discriminatory; and appeared polarised by geopolitics. Political donations are labelled sinister because of a polarised political view.\nBoth major parties accept donations in a level playing field where the law applies to all. The Foreign Interference Transparency Scheme Act 2018 applies to all. This only applies to lobbying. To be really transparent, the bill should be extended to cover the donor, the amount and to which political party.\nThere is one quite notable difference between the Bible and the Koran on the point of violence (Letters, February 2-3). The message of the Koran will never be changed. Unlike nearly all of the Old Testament verses of violence, the verses of violence in the Koran are mostly open ended, meaning that they are not restrained by the historical context of the surrounding text as in the Bible.\nIn the battle for Mosul, it is alleged 18 civilians were killed by Australian Defence Force Super Hornets (\"PM says 'not clear' ADF killed civilians\", Februrary 2-3). Were we at war? Yes? Do civilians get killed as collateral damage in wars? Yes. Then why is there always a fuss about such minimal deaths? I am proud of our ADF, and especially proud of the accuracy of our skilled pilots who risk their lives in strategic battles instigated by our politicians.\nI am proud to be an Aussie when I read: \"Officers negotiated with a man before firing beanbag rounds to resolve the situation\" (\"Man charged after 'emergency situation' at Brisbane International Airport\", smh.com.au, February 3)."

        "output": "also venerate the saints, but do not combine their commemorations. Instead, the Byzantine tradition remembers St. Titus on Aug. 25 and St. Timothy on Jan. 22.\nThe son of a Jewish mother and a non-Jewish father, Timothy came from Lystra in present-day Turkey. His mother, Eunice, and his grandmother, Lois, are known to have joined the Church, and Timothy himself is described as a student of Sacred Scripture from his youth.\nAfter St. Paul\u2019s visit to Timothy\u2019s home region of Lycaonia, around the year 51, the young man joined the apostle and accompanied him in his travels. After religious strife forced Paul to leave the city of Berea, Timothy remained to help the local church. Paul later sent him to Thessalonica to help the Church during a period of persecution.\nThe two met up again in Corinth, and Timothy eventually journeyed to Macedonia on Paul\u2019s behalf. Problems in the Corinthian Church brought Timothy back for a time, after which he joined Paul and accompanied the apostle in subsequent travels.\nLike Paul, Timothy endured a period of imprisonment in the course of his missionary work. His release is mentioned in the New Testament Epistle to the Hebrews.\nAround the year 64, Timothy became the first bishop of the Church of Ephesus. During that same year, he received the first of two surviving letters from St. Paul. The second, written the next year, urges Timothy to visit St. Paul in Rome, where he was imprisoned before his martyrdom.\nAncient sources state that St. Timothy followed his mentor in dying as a martyr for the faith. In the year 93, during his leadership of the Church in Ephesus, he took a stand against the worship of idols and was consequently killed by a mob. The pagan festival he was protesting was held Jan. 22, and this date was preserved as St. Timothy\u2019s memorial in the Christian East.\nIn contrast with Timothy\u2019s partial Jewish descent and early Biblical studies, St. Titus \u2013 who was born into a pagan family \u2013 is said to have studied Greek philosophy and poetry in his early years. But he pursued a life of virtue, and purportedly had a prophetic dream that caused him to begin reading the Hebrew Scriptures.\nSt. Paul was not only Titus\u2019 spiritual father, but also depended on his convert as an assistant and interpreter. Titus accompanied Paul to the Apostolic Council of Jerusalem during the year 51, and was later sent to the Corinthian Church on two occasions. After the end of Paul\u2019s first imprisonment in Rome, the apostle ordained Titus as the Bishop of Crete.\nPaul sent his only surviving letter to Titus around the year 64, giving instructions in pastoral ministry to his disciple as he prepared to meet up with him in the Greek city of Nicopolis. Titus evangelized the region of Dalmatia in modern Croatia before returning to Crete.\nTitus is credited with leading the Church of Crete well into his 90s, overturning paganism and promoting the faith through his prayers and preaching. Unlike St. Timothy, St. Titus was not martyred, but died peacefully in old age."

It became one of the most controversial and sensitive issues in the NFL, with players saying their messages last year were being misconstrued, while others - including President Donald Trump - called them unpatriotic. Trump even said NFL owners should fire any player who refused to stand during the anthem.\n\"We're here for a bigger platform,\" Raiders tight end Jared Cook said during the spring. \"We're not just athletes.

        "input": "From its best angles, the Tramontana XTR looks like a crazy pod race car from a galaxy far far away, with a see-through canopy and two seats laid out in tandem like a fighter jet. From the side, the proportions are weirdly long, reminiscent of the wacky Youabian Puma, but",
        "output": "weird is just what we need in these offensively inoffensive silver-beige times.\nWhen I went to check out the Lane Motor Museum\u2019s Microcar Mania exhibit earlier this year, I was left longing for the era when people used to build truly, wonderfully odd cars.\nThankfully, there\u2019s a few niche automakers out there like Tramontana letting their freak flag fly to the tune of a gigantic Mercedes twin-turbo V12. I spent a little time poking around the XTR at the Circuit of the Americas track day hosted by Scuderia Society and McLaren Houston this weekend, speaking with representatives from the small Spanish marque\u2019s American team about the car.\nOne very large twin-turbo Mercedes V12, perfectly color-coordinated with the rest of the suspension and engine bay because they can.\nWe first noticed the Spanish-made Tramontana R several years ago\u2014which, of course, we noted was not pretty. The XTR is their latest, more refined bag of peculiarity that\u2019s a bit sleeker than the R and far better looking from the front.\nBut thank heavens, it\u2019s still hilariously, delightfully bizarre. You can take the easy road, crinkle your nose in a face and call it ugly, but deep-down you know that this is the strangeness that cars need so hard right now.\nEach XTR is handbuilt to a customer\u2019s needs and wants at their factory in Barcelona. Tramontana is just starting to make them, though, so what I saw was the first XTR in the United States. They want to bring over a second car by the end of the year, and crank up production to four or five per year eventually. Needless to say, your neighbors probably won\u2019t have the same car if you end up with one of these.\nThe XTR is a full-carbon-fiber-bodied car that weights only 2,900 lbs despite having a gigantic Mercedes V12 in the middle. But when the V12 pumps out 720 horsepower, 2900 lbs is nothing to get moving. There are three traction control settings (and an \u201coff\u201d mode) to save your bacon (or not) in various degrees.\nThat twin-turbo V12 power gets funneled through a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission, which is very much like a race car\u2019s insofar as you have to use a clutch to get it going, but not after that. From there, you can terrify the passenger behind you to your heart\u2019s content.\nJust don\u2019t expect the passenger to have any room back there. When I sat down to try out the back seat, all 5'4\" of me found that the room for my knees was around the driver\u2019s seat.\nThe seat itself\u2014complete with fabulously insane trim made of gold-treated leather shipped in from Bulgaria\u2014was comfortable. Yet the leg room for that rear seat reminded me of itty bitty supercar seats that are more suited for a small purse and some mail than a full-sized human.\nThe front seat was much more comfortable, with plenty of room between myself and the pedals. There\u2019s an easy step to help you climb over the side of the car to hop inside, but needless to say, this isn\u2019t a car that\u2019s all that hospitable to anyone in a short dress.\nEach interior is custom, with regular-car items like air conditioning and a stereo system available to add to the carbon-fiber-topped ledges that stuck out on either side of the driver\u2019s seat.\nEven the XTR\u2019s paint job was amusingly weird. Instead of going the conventional route and having gold vinyl overlaid on the matte black car, they wrapped it in gold chrome first, and then painted the matte black over the gold.\nNo, that didn\u2019t make sense to me, either. I\u2019m convinced that this was done specifically to make people go \u201cwait, what?\u201d when they notice the black paint raised over the layer of shiny gold. If so, mission accomplished!\nThis XTR was Tramontana\u2019s more roadgoing version. The bubble canopy and tandem seat layout are meant to provide you unparalleled views of what\u2019s around you on track. The racing version has an even more wide-open bubble with fewer support beams interrupting your view.\nThe XTR is not conventionally pretty under even the most bizarrely skewed definitions of \u201cpretty,\u201d but I\u2019m definitely glad it exists. I\u2019m tired of seeing too many automakers play it safe and churn out annoyingly similar cars year after year, even at the supercar level. The world needs more patently absurd cars like the Tramontana so we can find the next cool thing.\nExperiment! Try odd things! Build them and watch as we ooh, aah, or cringe at how lovely or strange they are! After all, how do we know what\u2019s beautiful if someone doesn\u2019t occasionally miss the mark, or go incredibly function-over-form in a good, wacky way like the XTR?\nThe XTR\u2019s frunk. Clearly, it\u2019s not a car meant for hauling large things.\nAdjustable suspension, because track car."

        "input": "The leaders don't have much in common, but each is fighting at home to engage in real diplomatic talks rather than military posturing.\nUnless you\u2019re someone who relishes the prospect of U.S.-Iran conflict, President Barack Obama\u2019s speech to the United Nations General Assembly yesterday didn\u2019t disappoint. Recognizing the opportunity presented by",
        "output": "the new Iranian president, the speech marked a return to the conciliation of Obama\u2019s first term, only this time backed up by several years\u2019 worth of economic sanctions.\nWhile it\u2019s easy to dismiss Obama\u2019s reiteration of America\u2019s commitment to the United Nations at the top of the speech as the usual internationalist boilerplate, the importance of robust American participation in multilateral institutions is something that has underpinned his administration\u2019s approach to foreign policy. (For a wide-angle view of the speech, read John Judis\u2019s excellent take.) It\u2019s this approach\u2014pursuing U.S. goals within a broader multilateral framework\u2014that has facilitated the ongoing international effort to pressure and cajole Iran to address concerns over its nuclear program.\nNotably, the speech left out the usual \u201call options on the table\u201d talk that actually serves to diminish, rather than strengthen, the threat of force. A country that keeps an aircraft carrier parked in the Persian Gulf doesn\u2019t have to remind anyone of its options.\nAs for Iranian President Hassan Rohani, while he couldn\u2019t help but benefit from comparisons to his predecessor, 9/11-truther and Holocaust denier Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, his speech was a bit of a let down. After several weeks of conciliatory statements and gestures, Rohani delivered a frank, sometimes rambling assertion of Iran's own interests and rights. It was an important reminder that negotiations between Iran and the P5+1 (the countries with permanent membership on the U.N. Security Council, plus Germany) will not be easy. Still, even if Rohani\u2019s outreach didn\u2019t match Obama\u2019s, the speech contained an important message that Rohani\u2019s government stands to address the international community's concerns over its nuclear program and to engage constructively over other regional issues, particularly Syria. The real work will begin when the foreign ministers sit down together later this week.\nIn as much as he meant it to be heard in Iran as well as New York, Rohani\u2019s speech was also a reminder that he has his own hawkish domestic politics to deal with. And he understands that Obama has the same problem.\nSome have sought to torpedo Obama\u2019s diplomacy by raising the bar unrealistically high. A group of Republican senators sent the president a letter insisting that Iran must be denied the right to domestic uranium enrichment\u2014broadly understood as a nonstarter for any realistic agreement\u2014and throwing a demand for political reform into the mix. Rather than pause to explore the possibilities of Rohani\u2019s offer, the senators write, \u201cnow is the time to increase pressure and stand with the Iranian people,\u201d as if standing with the Iranian people could be accomplished by rejecting the diplomatic initiatives of the man they just elected, and over the presumed preferences of Iran\u2019s own supreme leader.\nThen there\u2019s Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, who from the moment Rohani was elected has insisted that Iran\u2019s new president is \u201ca wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing.\u201d The usual groups have followed Netanyahu\u2019s lead in making that case in the U.S.\nObserving the hubbub over a possible handshake between Rohani and Obama, which ended up not happening, former Bush administration Middle East policy hand Michael Doran, one of the Obama administration\u2019s fiercest Twitter critics, scoffed, \u201cFor the greatest power on Earth, a democracy, to run panting after a two-bit terrorist state is an unseemly spectacle.\u201d While this is obviously a tendentious rendering, it\u2019s quite useful for what it reveals about the hawkish mind-set: In seeking an un-hostile encounter with Rohani, Obama failed to uphold American pride. One can easily imagine the Farsi version of this coming out of the Revolutionary Guard headquarters: For a great historic power such as Iran to run panting after the Great Satan is humiliating for us.\nTo be clear, no one is claiming that Rohani is some sort of magical peacenik Santa Claus. He\u2019s a member of the Iranian revolutionary elite\u2014indeed, that\u2019s precisely why he is now able to operate with the supreme leader\u2019s support. Nor is anyone insisting that the web of sanctions currently in place should be unwound simply because Rohani has a grandfatherly smile. But, at the very least, it should be obvious that now isn\u2019t the moment to pile on new sanctions. And it\u2019s hard to think of a worse idea than for Congress to pass a resolution authorizing military force against Iran, as Senator Lindsey Graham has said he's preparing to do, right at the moment that Iran\u2019s president is engaged in the most sustained outreach to the United States since the revolution.\nA key divide right now is between those who recognize that Iran has politics, and those who don\u2019t. For those who don\u2019t, and who believe that Iran\u2019s government is unified and undifferentiated in its villainy, and that any appearance of disagreement is simply projected onto Iran by na\u00efve Westerners, nothing the U.S. does or doesn\u2019t do really matters.\nBut others recognize that, even if the range of views within the regime is small, and has grown smaller over recent years, there is still some measure of disagreement over the value of rapprochement with the United States and that Iran\u2019s supreme leader has, against his own inclinations and suspicions, given Rohani some room to run.\nIs Rohani serious, or is it all a trick? In the end, there\u2019s only one way to find out: Talk. As Rohani himself has made clear, his time is limited. He has his own skeptics to contend with, and just like Obama\u2019s, they\u2019re waiting to pounce if he doesn\u2019t deliver on his promises."

        "input": "Fifteen months after Yousry Bissada took over as chief executive officer, it\u2019s still a work in progress. The most visible scars from a crisis that pushed Home Capital to the brink of insolvency last year are beginning to fade. The bunker mentality that weighed on many employees \u2013 the ones",
        "output": "who didn\u2019t leave \u2013 has eased, and the alternative lender is turning a profit while gradually refilling its mortgage-business pipeline.\nThe company now faces a new array of challenges, including stiffer competition for clients and prospective homeowners who are already feeling increasing financial pressure from rising interest rates. Just as Home Capital looked to be recovering, some of the air pressure went out of major urban housing markets, and there are now more lenders battling for slices of a smaller pie.\nHome Capital new chief executive Yousry Bissada is seen in Toronto in this July, 2017, file photo.\nThat\u2019s partly a response to the vulnerability of Home Capital, which had been Canada\u2019s clear leader in \u201cnear-prime\u201d mortgage lending until last year\u2019s troubles, and is now determined to reclaim the top spot. Near-prime customers are those who cannot get mortgages from the major chartered banks for a variety of reasons, such as having a volatile income or a lower credit score.\nThe question on investors\u2019 minds is no longer one of survival, but rather: How profitable can the new Home Capital be?\nHome Capital\u2019s newfound stability has come at a significant cost. It now relies far less on cheap demand deposits brokered by investment dealers to fund its mortgage loans. The Bank of Canada has highlighted the risk in depending on such short-term funding, citing last year\u2019s run on Home Capital\u2019s high-interest savings deposits as evidence, and Home Capital has learned its lesson.\nMost of its funding now comes from more stable fixed-term products such as guaranteed investment certificates, but those are more costly to offer. To attract money, it is offering interest rates as high as 3.6 per cent on five-year GICs from its Oaken Financial subsidiary.\nProfitability has collapsed: At its peak in fiscal 2014, Home Capital earned nearly $4.50 a share, according to Standard and Poor\u2019s Capital IQ. In the 12 months ended June 30, it earned $1.55.\nThe lender is also sitting on excess capital, and some shareholders are growing impatient as they await a plan to return some of that cash through dividends or share buybacks. At $12.80, Home Capital\u2019s shares are languishing well below precrisis levels, trading at a steep discount to the lender\u2019s book value, which was $23.40 a share as of June 30.\nMr. Bissada insists that Home Capital\u2019s core business model is still sound. The lender made its name by catering to borrowers who don\u2019t quite fit the profile to qualify for a mortgage at a prime lender, such as a major bank. Many of its clients are new immigrants with short credit histories in Canada, or self-employed workers who find it harder to prove their incomes \u2013 both growing demographics. These borrowers also pay higher interest rates on home loans from Home Capital \u2013 typically 4.5 per cent or more \u2013 to compensate for their riskier profiles.\nHome Capital hired outside consultants to do a deep analysis of the market, bolstering Mr. Bissada\u2019s conviction that Home Capital is an \u201cextraordinarily healthy business to keep investing in,\u201d he says, tucking into a sandwich lunch in his office, flanked by chief financial officer Brad Kotush.\nWhen Mr. Bissada joined Home Capital as CEO last August amid an overhaul of its senior management and board, the company was badly damaged. Nearly a third of its 910 staff had resigned after allegations that the company misled investors about fraud in its mortgage broker channel scared off investors, sparking a run on deposits. In the depths of the crisis, Home Capital was forced to tell brokers, \u201cwe can\u2019t fund your mortgage. \u2026 Go find another lender,\u201d Mr. Bissada says.\nEven as Home Capital\u2019s funding stabilized \u2013 with help from an equity infusion by Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. \u2212 Home Capital\u2019s employees were still shell-shocked. \u201cEverybody had PTSD,\u201d Mr. Bissada says. \u201cThey were afraid to do anything\u201d and quick to pass on deals, slowing the firm\u2019s recovery.\nAfter recent hiring, Home Capital is back up to 750 staff and issuing new mortgages at a faster pace \u2013 $1.23-billion of loans in the second quarter, including some commercial mortgages as it rebuilds a portfolio sold off in desperation last year. But its underwriters are working under more rigid rules, and must be less willing to overlook shortcomings in loan applications simply because the borrower has a hefty down payment. \u201cEvery mortgage is looked at in a deeper way to make sure it fits us,\u201d Mr. Bissada says.\nThe vast majority of Home Capital\u2019s loans are concentrated in Southern Ontario, and Mr. Bissada has plans to invest to improve the company\u2019s presence in cities across the country.\nOutside his office hangs a painting of a crumpled piece of paper \u2013 a symbol of Home Capital\u2019s long-term goal to be entirely paperless. For now, its style of mortgage lending relies heavily on teams of underwriters manually poring over stacks of documents.\nThe challenge now is to stay disciplined as competition for alternative mortgages heats up. Multiple new federal measures, including taxes on foreign buyers and tougher qualification rules for borrowers who take out uninsured mortgages, appear to have curbed increases in housing prices and dampened sales in major cities, such as Toronto and Vancouver. As a result, Home Capital has seen more intense competition for a smaller pool of loans among rivals such as Equitable Bank and Laurentian Bank of Canada, but also from other lenders, including credit unions moving more aggressively into the market. First National Financial Corp. recently reintroduced a program to issue near-prime loans and sell them to investors.\nPrivate lenders and mortgage investment corporations have also sprung up with tens or hundreds of millions of dollars to lend. Anecdotally, Mr. Bissada says he thinks private lenders are gaining ground, and a June report by the Bank of Canada showed that private lenders boosted their share of new mortgages in the Greater Toronto Area to 8 per cent since 2017, mostly through short-term loans.\nIn some ways, competition has made Home Capital less risky: Its average borrower now has a credit score above 700, up from 680 a couple of years ago, as applicants trickle down from large banks that are being more selective. More credit-worthy clients pay lower interest rates on mortgages, however, and that has squeezed Home Capital\u2019s margins. Those same clients often take out loans with Home Capital, then switch to another lender as their credit improves.\nThere are also concerns about Home Capital\u2019s unwieldy capital structure. Its common equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio \u2013 a key measure of a firm\u2019s financial buffer against bad loans \u2013 is much higher than industry norms, at 23.2 per cent. One shareholder, Kingsferry Capital Management Group Ltd., even publicly released a critical letter pressing Home Capital to buy back $60-million in shares.\nHome Capital executives now say streamlining the firm\u2019s capital is an urgent priority. But they must tread carefully under heightened scrutiny from Canada\u2019s banking regulator, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions. As it stands, Home Capital is unlikely to announce its new capital plan until February at the earliest.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a number of shareholders say, \u2018Well, that\u2019s too long.\u2019 We\u2019ve had others that have suggested that they\u2019re happy with the pace,\u201d says Mr. Kotush, the CFO."

Since then, a novena mass was held every Friday at the San Jose Parish Church.\nBut \u201cDinagyang\u201d became a household name almost a decade later when a radio broadcaster insisted using a local every word to distinguish the festival from the well-known Ati-Atihan of Kalibo.

It begins with the Barter of Panay, the story of how 10 Bornean datus and their families fled a tyrannical ruler in Borneo early in the 13th century and sailed towards the island of Panay. When they arrived, the Borneans bargained with the native Atis to occupy the lowlands. To celebrate the barter,the Borneans painted their bodies with soot and danced with the Atis.\nBut what is baffling about the theatrical street performance is when the soot-painted warriors, who are depicting the native Atis, hoist up an image of the Holy Child of Jesus while chanting with great conviction: \u201cViva, Se\u00f1or Santo Ni\u00f1o!\u201d The Spaniards only came to Philippine shores during the 16th century.\nSetting aside historical inaccuracies, the Dinagyang is a much-awaited annual event that draws both Ilonggos and visitors.

        "output": "of the Bills, and the NFL, is upon us.\nBrady is now 41 years old, and at various points this season, Gisele's husband has started to look his age.\nNot that he\u2019s Johnny Unitas playing out the string with the Chargers, a shell of his former greatness, because during New England\u2019s 24-12 victory over Buffalo, Brady did surpass the 4,000-yard passing mark for the ninth time.\nBut at long last, the greatest quarterback in the history of the game is looking fallible, and his reign of terror over the Bills, Jets and Dolphins in the AFC East is nearing its conclusion. Really, I think it is.\nBrady could not have been more average, dare I say below average, in this game. Buffalo held him to 126 passing yards, picked off two of his passes, and his only TD pass wouldn\u2019t have happened if not for a heads-up play by wide receiver Julian Edelman.\nHowever, if anyone was thinking the AFC East torch might be passed from Brady to Buffalo\u2019s Josh Allen, sorry, not yet.\nAllen\u2019s stock-market season took another dip as he looked overwhelmed at times against Bill Belichick\u2019s defense. He completed 20 of 41 passes for 217 yards with a TD and two picks for a rating of 52.6. He rushed for only 30 yards, and simply wasn\u2019t up to the task of beating the Patriots in his first try.\nWe all knew this is what it was going to be like with Allen, at least in his rookie year. He is learning and gaining experience each week, but he remains a raw, unmolded talent who has been put in a difficult situation because he is surrounded with such incompetence on offense.\nAllen made several questionable decisions, on some plays he held the ball too long in the pocket, and he was wildly inaccurate on a few throws, two of which ended up as interceptions. But he also got no help from his receivers, and while he wasn\u2019t sacked, let\u2019s not make the jump that the line played well, because it didn\u2019t.\nOne more week to go. One more week for Allen playing with this slop around him. And then when it\u2019s over, we wait with great anticipation to see how general manager Brandon Beane goes about bringing capable players in to help him for that time when, we hope, he finally wrests the torch away from Brady.\nWhatever it was that LeSean McCoy said or did before Sunday\u2019s game, it was far weightier than anything he did on the field.\nMcCoy had yet another terrible day as he gained only 9 yards on six carries and had zero impact on the game. This is nothing new in 2018 as McCoy now has seven games where he rushed for less than 25 yards, three of which were a single-digit total.\nIf that wasn\u2019t bad enough, we found out after the game that the reason McCoy wasn\u2019t on the field for the first offensive play of the game was due to a disciplinary decision by McDermott.\nIt must not have been too serious because McCoy was on the field for the second play, but for a guy like McCoy who pays attention to his career stats, it had to hurt that he lost a game start over this, and rookie Keith Ford got to check that box for the first time.\nMcCoy was asked about his future in Buffalo, which seems like it has one week left. Given the way he has played, it seems ludicrous for the Bills to consider bringing him back in 2019, though he's not buying that.\nMore: LeSean McCoy lost his job to an undrafted rookie. Are his days in Buffalo almost over?\nAnother player who is unlikely to be back in 2019 is tight end Charles Clay, and that came into crystal clear focus when he was announced as inactive, a healthy scratch.\nTo decipher that, it means this: Clay has been terrible all year with 21 catches for 184 yards, he has done nothing impactful, and the Bills need to see if Jason Croom and/or Logan Thomas are worth moving forward with next year.\nCutting Clay would save the Bills $4.5 million on the cap, so that seems prudent. However, one has to wonder what to make of Croom and Thomas. Croom flashes, and he had four catches for 55 yards Sunday, but he also lost his second fumble of the season in a situation where he was fighting for extra yardage and didn\u2019t secure the ball.\nThomas had one ball thrown his way, and he failed to catch it. He has great size and athleticism, but it\u2019s not showing up on game day.\n\u25ba Player of the game: Sony Michel. The Patriots rookie running back did not play in the first game against the Bills, and now we know why the Patriots couldn\u2019t run the ball that night at New Era Field. Michel gained 116 yards and scored a first-half touchdown.\n\u25ba Play of the game: Edelman\u2019s 32-yard touchdown catch and run. The Patriots were clinging to a 14-6 lead and had fourth-and-4. Edelman got open over the middle for the first down, and he, Jordan Poyer and Rafael Bush all went to the ground together. However, Edelman was never down, and he knew it, so he popped up and sprinted the final 15 yards to the end zone for the score that broke the game open.\n\u25ba Unsung hero: Lorenzo Alexander was all over the field as he had a game-high 14 tackles, made a nice interception, and also rushed Brady into a throwaway. At 35, Alexander remains a marvel.\n\u25ba Injuries: LB Julian Stanford left the game in the first quarter with an ankle injury, and WR Deonte Thompson went out in the third quarter with a toe injury. Neither player was able to return.\n\u25ba What\u2019s next: The Bills close the 2018 season at home Sunday at New Era Field against the Dolphins, who suffered a sickening 17-7 loss to Jacksonville and are now eliminated from playoff contention."

But the answer to your question is yes and no. It is, in the grand scheme of things, a monumental waste of time and money. It is a video game.

Well, really, they haven't been much of an unconditional friend to any industry.\nThey created a platform that allowed for massive growth in social gaming, which created that monstrous Farmville company Zynga.

One could argue that this is Facebook's prerogative and it's their ecosystem. That would be fair. One could also argue that sharing is now the currency of the social web and this would be like the Treasury coming and saying, \"Hey, everybody, $20 bills are useless now!

        "output": "citizen do?\nAlthough as citizens, you and I do not have the power to make laws [our Constitution gave Parliament the power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Solomon Islands] there are avenues that we can use to give our views and/or contributions on new laws or proposed amendments to existing laws.\nSubmissions made to the Bills and Legislation Committee (\u201cthe Committee\u201d) is one such avenue.\nThe Committee is responsible for reviewing draft Bills before they are introduced into Parliament. In its review process, the Committee calls for public submissions through newspaper advertisements or by contacting organisations and individuals with known interest in the Bill to appear before it in person.\nOnce consultations and inquiry into the Bills are complete, the Committee will make its report to Parliament containing the observation and recommendations arising from the consultations.\nCurrently there are 8 Bills in Parliament namely; (1) The Anti-Corruption Bill 2017, (2) The Constitution (Amendment) (Dual Citizenship) Bill 2017, (3) The Citizenship Bill 2017, (4) The Strata Titles Bill 2017, (5) The Prescription of Ministers (Amendment) Bill 2017, (6) The Legal Profession Bill 2017, (7) The Whistle-blowers Protection Bill 2016; and (8) The Constitution (Amendment) (Electoral Reform) Bill 2018.\nOn Wednesday 14th February 2018, the Committee advertised in the Solomon Star newspaper a call for submissions from individuals, groups and organisations who wish to express their views, knowledge or experiences on the Anti-Corruption Bill 2017 and the Constitution (Amendment)(Electoral Reform) Bill 2018.\nTransparency Solomon Islands was given an opportunity through this call to the public for submissions, and we made our submission to the Committee on the Anti-Corruption Bill 2017.\nWe later received an invitation from the Committee to submit on the Constitution (Amendment) (Electoral Reform) Bill 2018.\nFor this article, TSI wishes to share our submission on the Anti-Corruption Bill 2017.\nWe believe that we need to continuously bring to the fore this issue of fighting corruption and the fact that not only is it important to have anti-corruption laws, but such laws must be robust to help in the fight against corruption.\nStrong laws that will enable the rights, duties, powers and responsibilities of individuals and authorities to whom this legislation applies.\nLaws that will contribute to the improvement of our ranking in the Corruption Perception Index. Last year 2017 Solomon Islands scored very badly [ Score 39, Rank 85] of the 180 countries assessed.\nMuch of that can be attributed to our leaders, dilly-dulling over the anti-corruption bills after assuring the people of this country, of their commitment to fight corruption, since 2015.\nIn their dilly-dulling they have now gone as far as including clauses to protect themselves and their cronies from being investigated and excluding clauses that would make a difference and have a real impact on corruption in this country, using the Constitution as an excuse.\nIf it is already there, why put in the Bill \u2013 simply to protect their corrupt conducts being investigated.\nBelow is an extract from our submission to the Bills and Legislative Committee.\nTSI is of the view that, given our country\u2019s urgent need to have an Anti-Corruption legislation in place, the Bill in its current form is adequate for passage. There are however three (3) issues that TSI would like to submit on, namely (i) Section 6 \u2013 Application of the Bill, (ii) Custom as Defense, and (iii) Unexplained Wealth.\n(1) This Act does not apply in relation to conduct that occurred before this Act commenced.\nFor reasons of this inquiry, it is also vital to understand the inherent powers vested by the Constitution in Parliament. The Constitution empowered the parliament to make retrospective laws, this is by virtue of section 59 which provided that Parliament is permitted to make laws for \u2018the peace, order and good government of Solomon Islands\u2019. Section 59(3) further provides that \u2018Parliament may \u2026 make laws, subject to section 10(4) of this Constitution with retrospective effect\u2019.\nTSI strongly believes that, for the purposes of the Commission\u2019s inquiry into this Bill, it is essential that the Commission must ask the question of whether there are new offences being created by the Bill and how it applies in view of s10(4) of the Constitution and the general rule at common law in regards to presumption against retrospective operation.\nTSI strongly believes that only if we can ask this question and honestly answer it, can we rightly say that we need s6 to ensure that we avoid holding someone guilty of a conduct that was not deemed an offence at the time the conduct occurred.\nFor ease of reference we would like to outline the new offences created by the Bill. These can be found in Part 5 \u2013 General offences (s51 \u2013 s54).\nThese offences relate only to conducts/acts that impedes the functions of the Commission and not conducts/acts that occurred before the Anti-Corruption Act comes into effect. Sections 51 looks at the offence of providing misleading information or documents to the Commission or its officers.\nSection 52 looks at the offence of impersonating an authorised officer. Section 53 looks at the offence of obstructing or threatening an authorised officer and section 54 looks at the offence of disclosure of confidential information.\nWhilst we must not ignore the fact that the rule at common law stipulates that a statute ought not be given a retrospective effect, the inherent powers vested by the Constitution in Parliament empowers Parliament to pass statutes with retrospective effects.\nTSI understands or knows that the SI Parliament has passed laws in the past with retrospective operation. One such example is the Members of Parliament (Entitlements)(Amendment) Regulations 2009, were published in the Gazette as Legal Notice No. 45 of 2009 on 6 July 2009 and made to come into force with retrospective effect on 1st April 2009.\nWe ask \u201cIs the parliament going to pass laws and pass them retrospectively only if it benefits Members of Parliament and put in this provision in any law that threatens their benefit or that which is not beneficial to them?\u201d.\nIn conclusion with regards to Issue 1, TSI is of the view that there is no justification to include section 6, as the Bill does not offend against section 10(4) of the Constitution.\nThe only effect of s6 will be to prevent the new Anti-Corruption Commission from investigating and prosecuting historical offences, which they would otherwise do according to the law that was in force at the time the offences were allegedly committed.\nIt will not change any rights and liabilities of people affected by the amendments. It will only shield past criminal action from scrutiny by the Commission. Section 6 must be removed.\nThe second issue that TSI would like to submit on is the inclusion of custom as a defence.\nThe inclusion of custom in the current proposed amendments to the Penal Code means that in the event that a person is charged with the offence of bribery, it is a defence to a prosecution that the defendant acted (ie:-promised, offered and/or gave the benefit) in accordance with custom.\nThe defence of custom is a good example of bad law, particularly when one considers its application in the context of Solomon Islands where wantokism or nepotism is a common and prevalent factor that contribute much to corrupt practices in the country.\nGiven the broad inferences that \u2018custom\u2019 in Solomon Islands context can imply, TSI strongly submits that the provisions in the proposed amendments to the Penal Code making references to the defence of custom must be removed.\nThe inclusion of custom undermines the purposes of the bribery offences. Furthermore, this defence is susceptible to abuse and may discourage prosecutions for charges of corruption initiated on the basis of the bribery offences.\nIn conclusion with regards to Issue 2, TSI submits that the defence of custom be removed from being used as a defence to prosecution of Bribery offences in PART X of the revised Penal Code.\nThe final issue that TSI would like to submit on is a call to include \u2018Unexplained Wealth\u2019 in the Bill.\nTSI is of the view that the accumulation of unexplained wealth by public officials must be included in the Bill.\nCorruption is rife in our country. Although it would be impossible to claim that we can eradicate corruption instantaneously, having a strong piece of legislation that would adequately address corruption offences is a step in the right direction of combatting corruption.\nSolomon Islands is party to the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC). Article 20 of the UNCAC criminalised unexplained/illicit wealth.\nOur government is sworn to serve the interest of our people and country. It is time that we must avoid painting a glamorous picture of SI adhering to the United Nations Charters whilst in our domestic levels, it is anything but.\nTSI would like to remind the Commission that during your inquiry into the Bill, bear in mind that it is the \u2018position\u2019 held by the public official that necessitates having such provision in our anti-corruption legislation. This is to deter and avoid abuse of such a public office.\nIf indeed we are serious about tackling corruption, we must include \u2018unexplained wealth\u2019 in the Bill.\nWith regards to issue 3, TSI submits that \u2018unexplained wealth must be included in the Bill.\nIn conclusion, TSI would like to once again commend the Commission for carrying out this inquiry giving TSI the opportunity to make this submission.\nTSI submits that we need to have in place a robust piece of legislation to combat corruption.\nHaving said that, TSI would like to strongly reiterate our submission on the three issues raised as follows; (i) That section 6 of the Anti-Corruption Bill 2017 must be removed, (ii) That defence of custom to prosecution of bribery offences must be removed from the proposed amendments to Part X of the revised Penal Code and (iii) That \u2018unexplained wealth\u2019 of public officials must be included in this Bill.\nTransparency Solomon Islands wishes to remind our fifty Members of Parliament the of the Civil Society Organisation, concerned individuals, citizen and the deaf and dumb group using sign language of their plea to you to be their champion, asking you to pass the anti-corruption bill without Clause 6 and custom as defence and inclusion of unexplained wealth, during the marking of the International Anti-Corruption Day 2017."

        "input": "In sports, business, politics, and life, the importance of self-confidence is repeated as one of the key components to success. Boston University School of Management Professors George Hollenbeck and Tim Hall define self-confidence as \u201cour judgment as to whether or not we can do something.\u201d They highlight that judgment is",
        "output": "the result of our thinking and is based on our perceptions. In addition, they emphasize that self-confidence is task-specific. This aspect of self-confidence underscored by Paul Hersey and Ken Blanchard in their Situational Leadership model, whereby a manager provides more direction to an employee with limited experience (and thus less confidence) for a specific task. In understanding self-confidence, Hollenbeck and Hall also show the importance that it can be changed over time.\nHow do hospitality managers build their self-confidence? Boston University School of Hospitality Administration seniors take a capstone course in leadership. Each semester, the seniors conduct field interviews to learn how these executives built their self-confidence. The following discussion reports findings from the student surveys collected since 2005. Students met with a wide range of hospitality leaders in operational and corporate positions, from hotel department heads and executive committee members, to restaurant general managers, upscale and luxury hotel property general managers, entrepreneurs, restaurant owners, contract food service companies, and senior-level hotel and hospitality corporation leaders. Participants ran the gamut of experience, including managers near the beginning of their careers and seasoned veterans with decades of experience and success. Over eight years, graduating hospitality seniors conducted more than 450 interviews. Whenever possible, interviews were conducted in person, at the interviewee\u2019s place of business and the student did not have a close, personal connection to the manager. Although the student may work for the same company, the interviewee was someone he or she did not know well (e.g., not a family member, close family friend, or someone who worked directly with him/her). The majority of the hospitality managers interviewed were from the New England / New York area.\nSeveral common themes developed from the industry interviews about the building of self-confidence. The top source for self-confidence in hospitality: experience. Many felt \u201cthere is no substitute for experience.\u201d World-class salesman Dale Carnegie agreed in the value of gaining experience\u2014Inaction breeds doubt and fear. Action breeds confidence and courage. If you want to conquer fear, do not sit home and think about it. Go out and get busy. By working in a job, becoming good at it, performing the functions well, and being successful, one can enhance one\u2019s self-confidence in that particular role.\nSecond, in connection to experience, many managers attributed their confidence and success by building upon small wins. Stephen Covey, author of The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, calls this baby steps: \u201cStart small, keep at it, and stay consistent until you\u2019re ready to pick up the pace.\u201d This reason was particularly prevalent when managers reminisced about their experiences shortly after graduating college. One restaurant manager, after discovering a poor corporate culture, implemented an employee \u201cfamily meal\u201d every night at 5. This simple action increased employee morale and enabled him to learn more about his staff.\nA director of sales & marketing found out that he was going to miss his sales quota by a huge number. Instead of trying to fix everything at once (an impossibility), he set small sales goals for each month and by the end of the year only missed his target by a small amount. A hotel manager for a five-diamond hotel identified building small wins with his first job as a bell person. Being responsible for making guests feel welcome, he had to learn how to make small talk with famous people, politicians, and presidents of corporations as he carried their luggage and provided an overview of the hotel operations and services.\nFourth, many of the managers recognized the importance of others who helped build their self-confidence. The three main sources of support came from bosses, family members, and mentors (who may or may not have been their direct supervisor). Most interviewees highlight at least one of these people, and many identified two or all three sources as helping them to gain confidence. Often the supervisor provided moral support\u2014a belief that the manager could accomplish the task, trusted them, and gave them the opportunity for success. For example, a relatively new restaurant chain manager\u2019s boss told her he believed in her and let her handle a large event. That belief boosted her confidence that she could take on the new challenge successfully.\nSeveral managers reiterated that their boss\u2019s emotional support and confidence in their ability to succeed helped raise their self-confidence. A director of housekeeping relied on support and advice from the director of operations when dealing with an upset guest for the first time. The director of operation\u2019s explanations and expectations gave her a clear understanding, giving her much more self-confidence when dealing with unhappy customers in the future. A general manager of a luxury hotel feeds off the high level of success and confidence from his senior corporate managers, boosting his own confidence since they believe in him. President Theodore Roosevelt reiterated this attribute: believe you can and you\u2019re halfway there.\nThe fifth pattern that emerged from the research is that learning from failure developed self-confidence. James Burke, former CEO of Johnson & Johnson, fiercely believes you can\u2019t build a business without making mistakes. Earlier in his career, he was once congratulated by the Chairman of the Board for the failure of a business line. Burke recalled the advice from Mr. Johnson, \u201cBusiness is all about making decisions. You don\u2019t make decisions without making mistakes. I just want to congratulate for that mistake. Don\u2019t ever make that mistake again, but please make sure you make other mistakes.\u201d Burke took that lesson to heart and taught it to those who worked for him.\nMany of the hospitality professionals interviewed openly discussed their mistakes and how they learned from their failures. This factor was specifically mentioned by almost two-thirds of the interviewees. Learning from their mistakes and overcoming their failures were important building blocks for increasing self-confidence and enabling future successes. An entrepreneur learned to carefully check invoices and pay attention to details, after he was once fired for not balancing invoices. A restaurant GM\u2019s career accelerated when he learned to own his mistakes instead of fearing them; in the process he also lost his arrogance. One room\u2019s division manager talked about how second-guessing his decisions caused his employees to not follow him. By following Burke\u2019s mantra of making decisions, right or wrong, and moving forward, he would learn from the results and become a better leader.\nTrust in others\u2014which is a large part of self-confidence since in this industry you cannot just pull off fabulous events by yourself.\nEvery mistake is an opportunity to learn.\nSet small goals and achieve them one at a time.\nNo one is infallible, everyone makes mistakes, so keep taking chances, learning from your missteps.\nSelf-confidence is something that is not given or taught, but something that you have to gain through experience.\nDon\u2019t be afraid to ask for help when you don\u2019t know how to do something, it\u2019s better than not doing it at all.\nThe important thing is to build your confidence by doing things you\u2019re good at. From there, you can slowly build your way up to difficult tasks that you previously dreaded.\nYou become successful when you make others successful.\nThe first step to building someone\u2019s self confidence is to give that person knowledge and respect.\nRemember, it\u2019s the little chutes and ladders along the way that make the game fun.\nConfidence is a precursor to strong leadership, especially in a group. Be supportive of situational leadership. Have someone who understands your weaknesses to bring out the best in each other.\nMany students were unsure of undertaking this task\u2014perhaps due to their lack of self-confidence in interviewing hospitality leaders. However, the overwhelming response after the task was successfully completed was that it was a worthwhile exercise. Reflecting on the assignment and the lessons from meeting with their interviewees, every student offered their own insights. Several revealed a better understanding of the importance of self-confidence in the hospitality industry. Even the illusion of self-confidence (\u201cfake it \u2019til you make it\u201d) is important for employees and customers to believe in you until you have real confidence to believe in yourself; the corollary to that is it is okay to have self-doubt as long as you keep trying new ventures. Working with others, setting goals and \u201clevel-five leadership\u201d (Jim Collins\u2019 research illustrating the combination of humility and fierce resolve among effective leaders) were additional concepts that emerged. Making mistakes, admitting failure, and using those experiences going forward were also themes many students highlighted. Although there were many more observations and personal reflections, a final important point students mentioned was that to be effective leaders themselves, it was important to build self-confidence for their subordinates, passing on their own experience and lessons to their staff.\nA vital information is being shared by you via this blog regarding \u201cHotel Management\u201d.

Both approaches will be necessary, because even if emissions are",
        "output": "dramatically decreased in the next decade, adaptation will still be needed to deal with the global changes that have already been set in motion.\nHumans have been adapting to their environments throughout history by developing practices, cultures and livelihoods suited to local conditions \u2013 from the Mediterranean siesta to the Vietnamese practice of building homes on stilts to protect against monsoonal rains. However, climate change raises the possibility that existing societies will experience climatic shifts (in temperature, storm frequency, flooding and other factors) that previous experience has not prepared them for.\nAdaptation measures may be planned in advance or put in place spontaneously in response to a local pressure. They include large-scale infrastructure changes \u2013 such as building defences to protect against sea-level rise or improving the quality of road surfaces to withstand hotter temperatures \u2013 as well behavioural shifts such as individuals using less water, farmers planting different crops and more households and businesses buying flood insurance.\nThe IPCC describes vulnerability to climate change as being determined by three factors: exposure to hazards (such as reduced rainfall), sensitivity to those hazards (such as an economy dominated by rain-fed agriculture), and the capacity to adapt to those hazards (for example, whether farmers have the money or skills to grow more drought-resistant crops). Adaptation measures can help reduce vulnerability \u2013 for example by lowering sensitivity or building adaptive capacity \u2013 as well as allowing populations to benefit from opportunities of climatic changes, such as growing new crops in areas that were previously unsuitable.\nLow-income countries tend to be more vulnerable to climate risks and some adaptation measures \u2013 such as increasing access to education and health facilities \u2013 will overlap with existing development programmes. But adaptation goes beyond just development to include measures to address additional risks specifically caused by climate change, such as raising the height of sea defences. It is still unclear how expensive these measures will be or who will pay for them, but the World Bank suggests adaptation could cost the same again as the world currently spends on development assistance.\n\u2022 This article was written by Susannah Fisher of the Grantham Research Institute at LSE in conjunction with the Guardian.\n\u2022 What is the Stern review?\n\u2022 Which nations are most responsible for climate change?"

Ramaphoria, I mean.\nRamaphoria is the warm, fuzzy feeling that washed over South Africa with the ascension of Cyril Ramaphosa to the presidency in December. With the departure of Jacob Zuma, the pall of gloom that had hung over the nation for almost",
        "output": "a decade was lifted.\nSuddenly all good things seemed possible again, in the \u201cnew dawn\u201d that Ramaphosa proclaimed. The sun came out, the rand surged, optimism soared.\nBut Ramaphoria was never going to be the same high-octane potion as the Rainbow Nation mampoer that South Africans had got vrot on more than two decades ago. The Ramaphosa gilding of the ANC lily is already wearing off in patches, revealing the tacky, cracked plastic below.\nThe rand is in retreat. The public mood has soured and is again turning rancorous.\nThe degree to which corruption and looting has gutted the economy is only beginning to be apparent, with bankruptcies looming in both the corporate and state-owned sectors. The ANC\u2019s Damascene commitment to expropriation without compensation has spooked investors, whatever the initial hopes that Ramaphosa would be able to limit the extent of the lunacy.\nThat the honeymoon is over was apparent in this week\u2019s fractious parliamentary exchange between the habitually genial Ramaphosa and the DA chief whip, John Steenhuisen. Irritated by Steenhuisen\u2019s continual sotto voce interjections while the president was outlining the benefits of the minimum wage, Ramaphosa lost his temper, telling Steenhuisen several times, in a torrent of anger, to \u201cshut up\u201d.\nThat is either uncharacteristic hyperbole or sudden disillusionment from Steenhuisen. After all, this is the man that City Press claimed earlier this year resigned from the DA\u2019s campaign team, because of the party\u2019s initially hostile reaction to the new president. Steenhuisen reportedly argued that the DA should have judged the public mood more accurately and welcomed Ramaphosa\u2019s election with graciousness.\nAnd that is how the scenery has shifted between acts in the Zuma-Phosa drama. The EFF accords a respectful silence to a president who has apparently embraced their most controversial policies, while a disenchanted DA fires barbs and, according to Ramaphosa, expletives.\nFor the phlegmatic Ramaphosa to lose his cool over some mild parliamentary barracking \u2013 his predecessor chortled happily through much worse \u2013 may indicate the pressure he is under. Not from the opposition gadflies, but from the hornets of which he has yet to draw the sting, nestling within the ANC.\nRamaphosa gained power by a narrow margin. While he has moved adroitly to consolidate his authority, the battle is far from over.\nZuma is clearly not contemplating an idyllic rural retirement. He is not going to be spending his time wallowing with wife-of-the-week in the Nkandla firepool.\nInstead, Zuma is continuing his war of legal attrition, smothering every attempt at putting him in the dock with an avalanche of counter-motions. He is also trying to bolster his provincial powerbase, while white-anting Ramaphosa everywhere, at every opportunity.\nThe precariousness of Ramaphosa\u2019s situation is illustrated by events in North West. Fury over the incompetence and corruption of the administration of ANC premier Supra Mahumapelo \u2013 strongly aligned with Zuma \u2013 has for week boiled over in violent protests.\nThere has been at least one death, as well as scores of injuries, as police clashed with tire-burning, shop-looting mobs demanding Mahumapelo\u2019s resignation. Vigilantes have barricaded hospitals and clinics, undoubtedly causing further deaths and misery.\nIn April, Ramaphosa cut short his trip to the United Kingdom to address the unrest. The textbook response to such anti-government violence is first to restore public order, then to address the root causes of the disaffection.\nRamaphosa has taken a more circuitous approach. While he wants to placate community anger by getting rid of Mahumapelo, this has to be done diplomatically, so as not to trigger a revolt by the Zuma faction in the ANC.\nIt seemed to be working. After meetings with Ramaphosa, Mahumapelo\u2019s resignation was announced on Tuesday. Then, just hours later, when it became apparent that Mahumapelo\u2019s successor would not be from the premier\u2019s camp, the resignation was withdrawn.\nInstead, Mahumapelo has decided to go on \u201cleave of absence\u201d and has appointed Finance MEC Wendy Nelson to act as premier in his place, while the behind-the-scene machinations continue. Nelson is certainly in Mahumapelo\u2019s camp \u2013 both he and she are accused in an alleged R160m fraud.\nTo survive for the long haul, Ramaphosa has to manoeuvre carefully in these fraught early stages. However, he may not have time on his side.\nFor years there have been sporadic and seemingly spontaneous eruptions of discontent in many parts of SA. This week a Human Sciences Research Council survey reported that 13% of North West residents now see public violence as an effective instrument of political change.\nFor a democracy, that is a chillingly high percentage. It makes for a vulnerable presidency and country."

It is part of a memorandum of understanding between the city and the school district, which lays out both parties responsibilities concerning handling of the human remains and the interment process. City council members voted to approve the agreement during Tuesday's meeting.\nOld Imperial Farm cemetery sits near the construction site and holds bodies believed to be from the convict-leasing system, where Texas state prisoners were contracted out to perform cheap labor. The human remains found at the construction site are believed to be African-American prisoners who were part of the convict-leasing system.\n\"I said four weeks ago when they presented these committees that this was busy work,\" said task force member Swatara Olushola during last week's meeting . \"Come on, these our ancestors we are talking about. This task force is a show. It is a show.\"\nSamuel Collins III, who spoke at Tuesday's city council meeting before the vote, resigned from the cemetery task force last week after learning about the agreement.\n\"It appeared the task force had been formed only to rubber stamp what the city and Fort Bend ISD had already agreed to,\" said Collins.\nThe city in August established the cemetery task force. Members were split into two committees to make recommendations concerning burial location and memorializing the remains. Over the last few weeks, they have presented ideas.\nThe school district has cited concern over whether it can legally turn the construction site into a perpetual care cemetery, which is why they recommended the remains be reburied at Old Imperial Farm Cemetery.\nJason Burdine, Fort Bend ISD board president, reiterated that message when he spoke during the city council meeting. He also noted the historical connection between Old Imperial Farm Cemetery and the bodies buried at the construction site.\n\"We know that we all share the desire to treat these individuals with respect,\" said Burdine. \"Respect comes in many forms and we understand that some of the members of the task force prefer to re-inter the bodies at the James Reese Center on the Fort Bend ISD site. However, as a public school district we are charged with educating children and the feasibility of becoming a perpetual care organization is beyond our expertise and our means.\"\nDespite the action during the city council meeting, the school district still has to receive permission from Fort Bend district court to re-inter the bodies at Old Imperial Farm Cemetery.\nAndrea Collins, a cemetery task force member and Missouri City resident, also spoke during the council meeting and urged city officials to keep the 95 bodies at the school district construction site.\n\"I strongly believe all of our voices should be heard and taken seriously,\" said Collins. \"At our previous meeting, I felt like the decision had already been made.

Heritage Foundation economic policy expert Brian Riedl dispels the stimulus myth, lays out the evidence that government spending does not end recessions--and presents the evidence for",
        "output": "what does end recessions. Hint: It's not another \"stimulus package.\"\nProponents of President Barack Obama's $787 billion stimulus bill continue to insist that the massive government bailout played a decisive role in moving the economy out of the recession. Yet assuming no destructive government actions, the economy's self-correction mechanism was widely expected to move the economy out of recession in 2009 anyway. With a parade of \"stimulus\" bills the past two years (going back to President George W. Bush's tax rebate in early 2008), it was entirely predictable that some would link the expected end of the recession to whichever stimulus bill happened to come last.\nDuring the 1930s, New Deal lawmakers doubled federal spending--yet unemployment remained above 20 percent until World War II.\nJapan responded to a 1990 recession by passing 10 stimulus spending bills over 8 years (building the largest national debt in the industrialized world)--yet its economy remained stagnant.\nIn 2001, President Bush responded to a recession by \"injecting\" tax rebates into the economy. The economy did not respond until two years later, when tax rate reductions were implemented.\nKeynesians believe that government spending can make up this shortfall in private demand. Their models assume that--in an underperforming economy--government spending adds money to the economy, taxes remove money from the economy, and so the increase in the budget deficit represents net new dollars injected. Therefore, it scarcely matters how the dollars are spent. Keynes is said to have famously asserted that a government program that pays people to dig and refill ditches would provide new income for those workers to spend and circulate through the economy, creating even more jobs and income.\nTaking this analysis to its logical extreme, Mark Zandi of Economy.com has boiled down the government's influence on America's broad and diverse $14 trillion economy into a simple menu of stimulus policy options, whereby Congress can decide how much economic growth it wants and then pull the appropriate levers. Zandi asserts that for each dollar of new government spending: temporary food stamps adds $1.73 to the economy, extended unemployment benefits adds $1.63, increased infrastructure spending adds $1.59, and aid to state and local governments adds $1.38. Jointly, these figures imply that, in a recession, a typical dollar in new deficit spending expands the economy by roughly $1.50. Over the past 40 years, this idea of government spending as stimulus has fallen out of favor among many economists. As this paper shows, it is contradicted both by empirical data and economic logic.\nEconomic data contradict Keynesian stimulus theory. If deficits represented \"new dollars\" in the economy, the record $1.2 trillion in FY 2009 deficit spending that began in October 2008--well before the stimulus added $200 billion more--would have already overheated the economy. Yet despite the historic 7 percent increase in GDP deficit spending over the previous year, the economy shrank by 2.3 percent in FY 2009. To argue that deficits represent new money injected into the economy is to argue that the economy would have contracted by 9.3 percent without this \"infusion\" of added deficit spending (or even more, given the Keynesian multiplier effect that was supposed to further boost the impact). That is simply not plausible, and few if any economists have claimed otherwise.\nAnd if the original $1.2 trillion in deficit spending failed to slow the economy's slide, there was no reason to believe that adding $200 billion more in 2009 deficit spending from the stimulus bill would suddenly do the trick. Proponents of yet another stimulus should answer the following questions: (1) If nearly $1.4 trillion budget deficits are not enough stimulus, how much is enough? (2) If Keynesian stimulus repeatedly fails, why still rely on the theory?\nMoving forward, the important question is why government spending fails to end recessions. Spending-stimulus advocates claim that Congress can \"inject\" new money into the economy, increasing demand and therefore production. This raises the obvious question: From where does the government acquire the money it pumps into the economy? Congress does not have a vault of money waiting to be distributed. Every dollar Congress injects into the economy must first be taxed or borrowed out of the economy. No new spending power is created. It is merely redistributed from one group of people to another.\nFor example, many lawmakers claim that every $1 billion in highway stimulus can create 47,576 new construction jobs. But Congress must first borrow that $1 billion from the private economy, which will then lose at least as many jobs. Highway spending simply transfers jobs and income from one part of the economy to another. As Heritage Foundation economist Ronald Utt has explained, \"The only way that $1 billion of new highway spending can create 47,576 new jobs is if the $1 billion appears out of nowhere as if it were manna from heaven.\" This statement has been confirmed by the Department of Transportation and the General Accounting Office (since renamed the Government Accountability Office), yet lawmakers continue to base policy on this economic fallacy.\nFirst, if money is not going to be printed, it has to come from somewhere. If the government borrows a dollar from you, that is a dollar that you do not spend, or that you do not lend to a company to spend on new investment. Every dollar of increased government spending must correspond to one less dollar of private spending. Jobs created by stimulus spending are offset by jobs lost from the decline in private spending. We can build roads instead of factories, but fiscal stimulus can't help us to build more of both. This form of \"crowding out\" is just accounting, and doesn't rest on any perceptions or behavioral assumptions.\nSecond, investment is \"spending\" every bit as much as is consumption. Keynesian fiscal stimulus advocates want money spent on consumption, not saved. They evaluate past stimulus programs by whether people who got stimulus money spent it on consumption goods rather than save it. But the economy overall does not care if you buy a car, or if you lend money to a company that buys a forklift.\nGovernment spending can affect long-term economic growth, both up and down. Economic growth is based on the growth of labor productivity and labor supply, which can be affected by how governments directly and indirectly influence the use of an economy's resources. However, increasing the economy's productivity rate--which often requires the application of new technology and resources-- can take many years or even decades to materialize. It is not short-term stimulus.\nCritics' Objection No. 1: People Are Saving Instead of Spending, and banks Are Not Lending.By Borrowing and Spending these \"Idle Savings,\" Government Can Circulate More Money Through the Economy.\nThis is the most common defense of government stimulus cited by policymakers. Indeed, among proponents of government spending there is a strong focus on whether people are spending or saving, with the implication that spending circulates through the economy while savings effectively drop out.\nBut savings do not drop out of the economy. Nearly all people put their savings in: (1) banks, which quickly lend the money to others to spend; (2) investments in stocks and bonds; or (3) personal debt reduction. In each of these situations, the financial system transfers one person's savings to someone else who can spend it. So all money is quickly spent regardless of whether it was initially consumed or saved. The only savings that drop out of the economy are those hoarded in mattresses and safes.\nSome contend that recession-weary banks are hoarding savings well beyond the legal minimum reserves. Yet even when banks hesitate to lend their deposits, they invest them in Treasury bills to keep them circulating through the economy and earning interest. In fact, the federal funds market--where banks lend each other any excess cash at the end of the day--exists because banks refuse to sit on unused cash even overnight. Thus, even in recessions, one person's savings quickly finances another person's spending.\nAdvocates of the \"idle savings\" theory fail to specify the location of all these newly hoarded piles of dollar bills they believe have been shielded from spending in the financial system. Even more telling, they also fail to explain--even if there were massive amounts of idle savings--how the federal government is supposed to acquire them for injection as new spending. After all, even if individuals, businesses, and banks were hoarding dollar bills in mattresses and safes, why would they suddenly lend them to the government to finance a stimulus bill? The very idea of hoarding dollars suggests these people and businesses would not trust the financial system, and would be quite unlikely to attend the next Treasury bill auction.\nStimulus spending advocates must be able to show that nearly all money lent to Washington would have otherwise sat idle in mattresses and bank safes. Otherwise, Washington is merely a middleman transferring purchasing power from one part of the economy to another--and the justification for government spending as stimulus collapses.\nCritics' Objection No. 2: Borrowing from Foreign Nations Can Provide \"New\" Money for the Economy.\nSelling goods and services to Americans and receiving American dollars in return. For the United States, these imports raise the trade deficit and thus reduce domestic demand. The government's subsequent borrowing back and spending of these dollars merely offsets the increased trade deficit.\nCritics' Objection No. 3: Government Spending Has a Multiplier Effect That Allows the Money to Re-circulate Through the Economy Multiple Times.\nThis point is correct but irrelevant to the question of stimulus. Yes, $100 in unemployment benefits can be spent at a grocery store, which, in turn, can use that $100 to pay salaries and support other jobs. The total amount of additional economic activity will be well above $100; but because government borrows the $100, that same money is now unavailable to the private sector--which would have spent the same $100 with the same multiplier effect.\nIn his 1848 essay, \"What Is Seen and What Is Not Seen,\" French economist Frederic Bastiat termed this the \"broken-window fallacy,\" a reference to a local myth that breaking windows would stimulate the economy by creating window-repair jobs. In reality, the window-repair spending comes out of funds that otherwise would have been spent (and created jobs) elsewhere in town. Today, the broken-windows fallacy explains why thousands of new stimulus jobs are not improving the total employment picture.\nCritics' Objection No. 4: During a Recession, Government Spending Can Put Unused Resources to Work.\nThis restates the overall spending fallacy. Yes, government spending can put under-utilized factories and individuals to work--but only by idling other resources in whatever part of the economy supplied the funds. If adding $1 billion would create 40,000 jobs in one depressed part of the economy, then losing $1 billion will cost roughly the same number of jobs in whatever part of the economy supplied Washington with the funds. It is a zero-sum transfer regardless of whether the unemployment rate is 5 percent or 50 percent.\nCritics' Objection No. 5: Government Reports Show That the Stimulus Has Already Created or Saved 640,000 New Jobs.\nAccording to a White House survey, businesses have used much of the $200 billion in stimulus dollars distributed thus far to hire or retain 640,000 workers. These figures have been ridiculed for their absurdity, such as reporting $6.4 billion spent in congressional districts that do not exist, and the survey's assertion that a single lawnmower purchase in Arkansas saved or created 50 jobs.\nThe White House says zero. The White House job numbers assume that all $200 billion is new and supports jobs that would not otherwise exist. But that could be true only if the private sector would have otherwise hoarded the entire $200 billion in safes and mattresses, where it could not be consumed, invested, or deposited in banks for investment spending--but instead turned the entire $200 billion over to the government.\nWhen dollars are transferred from one part of the economy to another, jobs will transfer accordingly. The White House's single-entry bookkeeping ignores the part of the economy that financed all these jobs. Not surprisingly, the nation's overall unemployment rate has continued to rise.\nCritics' Objection No. 6: Government Should Subsidize Consumption, Which Represents 60 Percent of the Economy.\nThis confuses the creation of income with its application. All income is applied somewhere in the economy: most on private consumption, some on private investment (converted from savings via the financial system), and some by government (taxed or borrowed out of consumption and investment). In the short run, the distribution of spending does not affect the total amount spent. The only way to increase consumption spending immediately is to take it from investment or government spending.\nGovernment Spending Can Have a Long-Term Impact.\nAlthough it cannot immediately increase economic growth, government spending can have a long-term impact. Economic growth results from producing more goods and services (not from redistributing existing income), and that requires productivity growth and growth in the labor supply. Productivity growth requires some combination of: (1) a more educated and efficient workforce; (2) more private physical capital, such as factories and tools; (3) increased use of new technology; (4) more public infrastructure like roads and other utilities; and (5) markets to set prices and rule of law to enforce contracts. Government's effect on economic growth is determined by its effect on productivity and labor supply.\nOnly in the rare instances where the private sector fails to provide those inputs in adequate amounts is government spending necessary. Government spending on education, physical infrastructure, and research and development, for instance, could increase long-term productivity rates--but only if government invests more competently than businesses, nonprofit organizations, and private citizens would have if those investment dollars had stayed in the private sector. Historically, governments have rarely outperformed the private sector in generating productivity growth. Thus, mountains of academic studies show that government spending typically reduces long-term economic growth.\nTax Policy's Strong Effect on Economic Growth.\nTaxes can affect growth, although not for the reason many people believe. Many tax cutters commit the same fallacy as do government spenders when asserting that tax cuts spur economic growth by \"putting spending money in people's pockets.\" Similar to government spending, the tax-cut cash does not fall from the sky. It comes from reduced investment and a higher trade deficit (if financed by budget deficits) or from government spending (if offset by spending cuts).\nHowever, certain tax cuts can add substantially to productivity. As stated above, economic growth requires that businesses produce increasing amounts of goods and services, and that requires consistent business investment and a growing, productive workforce. Yet high marginal tax rates-- defined as the tax on the next dollar earned--create a disincentive to engage in those activities. Reducing marginal tax rates on businesses and workers will increase incentives to work, save, and invest. These incentives encourage more business investment, a more productive workforce by raising the after-tax returns to education, and more work effort, all of which add to the economy's long-term capacity for growth.\nTax rebates fail to increase economic growth because they are not associated with productivity or work effort. No new income is created because no one is required to work, save, or invest more in order to receive a rebate. In that sense, rebates that write each American a check are economically indistinguishable from government spending programs. In fact, the federal government treats rebate checks as a \"social benefit payment to persons.\" They represent another feeble attempt at creating new purchasing power out of thin air rather than focusing on productivity.\nH. L. Mencken once wrote that \"complex problems have simple, easy to understand, wrong answers.\" He may as well have been referring to the idea that Congress can foster economic growth simply by \"injecting\" money into the economy. Government stimulus spending is not a magic wand that creates jobs and income. Repeated failed attempts in America and abroad have shown that governments cannot spend their way out of recessions. Focusing on productivity growth builds a stronger economy over the long term--and leaves America better prepared to handle future economic downturns.\nWhile the Obama Administration rhetorically emphasizes that it will \"save or create\" 3.5 million jobs, a January 2009 report by its economic team assumed creation of 3.3 million new jobs. The report projected that, through fall 2010, the baseline economy would lose 0.4 million net jobs (from 134.3 million to 133.9 million), while the economy with the stimulus would instead add 3.3 million net jobs (from 134.3 million to 137.6). See Christina Romer and Jared Bernstein, \"The Job Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan,\" January 9, 2009, p. 4, at http://otrans.3cdn.net/ 45593e8ecbd339d074_l3m6bt1te.pdf (December 7, 2009). Despite enactment of the stimulus, the number of jobs had fallen to 130.8 million through October 2009.\nFor more on the New Deal, see William W.

In the long run, however, a dollar spent on investment is likely to increase labor productivity and help the economy create more income and wealth in the future. By altering the composition of an economy's spending either toward or away from investment (and affecting the quality of those investments), governments can affect long-term productivity rates and economic growth.\nDozens of these studies are summarized in Daniel J.

Activists have responded by seeking to separate the alleged crime from the broader issue of immigration policy.\nOrrego-Savala was charged with four local felonies on Wednesday: two counts of failure to remain at the scene of an accident and two counts tied to drunken driving causing death. The former charges are each punishable by up to 16 years in prison; the latter charges are punishable by up to 12 years.\nHe also faces a federal charge of illegal re-entry of a previously deported alien. That charge, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana on Tuesday, could add 10 years in federal prison to any sentence Orrego-Savala might receive if convicted in the drunken-driving case.\nWearing orange jail garb, he appeared in Marion Superior Court on Wednesday morning for an initial hearing.\nJudge Grant Hawkins read Orrego-Savala's rights. Orrego-Savala said he hired an attorney.\nProsecutors requested a DNA sample. A pretrial hearing was set for March 27.\nAfter the hearing the defense attorney, Jorge Torres, told a gathering of reporters that the political rhetoric and media attention could make it impossible for his client to receive a fair trail.\n\"We have serious concerns,\" Torres said. The first thing posted in the media was his immigration status, he said.\n\"Drunk driving has nothing to do with immigration status.\"\nTorres said it was too soon to say whether Orrego-Savala would request his trial be moved out of Marion County because of the publicity.\nTorres said any future juror who lives in Marion County already has \"been exposed to the negative attention brought because of his (immigration) status.\"\nOrrego-Savala is believed to have entered the country illegally on or around July 1, 2004, according to ICE spokeswoman Nicole Alberico. He was convicted of driving under the influence in Redwood City, Calif., in 2005, Alberico said.\nIn October 2006, he was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in San Francisco and deported in January 2007, according to a federal criminal complaint.\nA little more than two years later, in March 2009, he was again arrested in San Francisco and deported that May.\nNeither the federal complaint or local court documents shed light on when Orrego-Savala re-entered the U.S. or when or why he traveled to Indiana.\nWhat is known is that Orrego-Savala was convicted last year in Boone County for driving without a license.\nBut he was arrested and charged under the name Alex Cabrera-Gonsales, one of many aliases that he has used, according to local and federal authorities. He used a similar name when State Police arrested him Sunday.\nVariations on the spelling of Orrego-Savala appeared in several convictions out of California, including one for drunken driving in September 2005.\nHe was charged in Marion County under the name Orrego Zavala.

And what about Monica Rambeau.\nLike every other film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, \u201cCaptain Marvel\u201d only loosely adapts from the",
        "output": "comic books, streamlining a hell of a lot. It does a fine job of bringing together characters who are only loosely-connected in the comics, and it boasts a strong, diverse cast to boot. But what is the actual history of Captain Marvel?\nThat\u2019s a huge question. The answer involves not only characters like Mar-Vell and Carol Danvers, but a cosmic badass partly inspired by actress Pam Grier, some extremely convoluted alien relations, and the first Muslim character to headline a Marvel comic book. Strap in because it\u2019s complicated, weird as hell (this is a good thing), and occasionally ahead of its time.\nTo start, in the comics Carol Danvers isn\u2019t the first Captain Marvel, or even the second \u2014 she\u2019s the seventh. The first is Mar-Vell.\nCreated in 1967 by Stan Lee and Gene Colan, Mar-Vell was a Kree warrior sent to earth on an observation mission with the ultimate goal of destroying the planet. Because of course.\nMar-Vell goes to work for NASA, where he meets Carol Danvers, NASA\u2019s head of security. He develops feelings for Carol, and sympathy for humanity as a whole, and eventually turns on the Kree to protect the earth. A lot of crazy-as-hell comic book stuff happens over the years, and he even becomes the arch enemy of Thanos (yes, that Thanos).\nUnfortunately, during one of his adventures Mar-Vell was exposed to powerful carcinogens, and because he was considered a traitor, the Kree denied him access to their advanced medical technology. So, unusually for a major comic character, Mar-Vell died for real, from cancer, in Marvel Comics\u2019 first-ever graphic novel, 1982\u2019s \u201cThe Death of Captain Marvel,\u201d written by Jim Starlin.\nMar-Vell\u2019s death cleared the way for a new hero to take over as Captain Marvel \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t Carol (yet). Created by writer Roger Stern and artists John Romita Jr. in 1982, the second Captain Marvel \u2014 and Marvel\u2019s first African-American female superhero \u2014 was Monica Rambeau.\nMonica is a New Orleans Harbor Patrol lieutenant who gets exposed to extra-dimensional energy that gives her the ability to transform into any form of energy within the electromagnetic spectrum, super-speed, and flight.\nStern and Romita initially drew inspiration from actress Pam Grier, but went much more glam than noir on the page. As you can see, Monica adopts a completely dope black and white costume that is easily one of Marvel\u2019s most iconic 1980s visuals. Though she eventually tones down the (awesome) Earth, Wind & Fire aspects of her first costume, Monica sticks with a variation on that striking color scheme in every subsequent costume.\nCalled the new Captain Marvel by the media, Monica accepts the moniker and with Spider-Man\u2019s help begins training with The Avengers to get her powers under control.\nMonica was even appointed the leader of the Avengers for a while, but in a 1988 storyline, she lost her powers and stepped down. Luckily she got them back, plus a few new ones, and returned a year later as the star of her own series, \u201cCaptain Marvel\u201d vol. 2, which lasted from 1989 to 1994.\nEventually, in a 1996 storyline Monica adopts a new superhero name, Photon; in 2006 she becomes Pulsar; and since 2010 she\u2019s been best known as Spectrum. And yes, she still rocks an amazing outfit. You can read a lot more about her here.\nMonica became Photon is because of Genis-Vell, the son of Mar-Vell, created in 1993 by Ron Marz and Ron Lim. Genis started calling himself Captain Marvel, he and Monica argued about it, and eventually out of respect for Mar-Vell, Monica let Genis have it.\nAwkwardly, Genis later started calling himself Photon. So, once again, Monica let Genis have the superhero name she was already using. It\u2019s a, uh, weird writing decision, but at least it eventually got us to the much cooler Spectrum.\nGenis was succeeded by Phyla-Vell (created by Peter David and Paul Azaceta) \u2014 read more about her here.\nPhyla-Vell was succeeded by Khn\u2019nr, a brain-damaged Skrull sleeper agent (created by Paul Jenkins and Tom Raney).\nAnd Khn\u2019nr was succeeded by Noh-Varr, who is currently known as Protector (created by Grant Morrison and J. G. Jones).\nWhich finally brings us back to Carol Danvers, and the hero she inspired, Kamala Khan.\nCreated in 1968 by Roy Thomas and Gene Colan, Carol starts out like her movie counterpart as a former air force officer.\nUnlike the film, where her powers come from the Tesseract (read all about that here), in the comics Carol leveled-up the old fashioned way: by being bombarded with radiation. She\u2019d been taken hostage by Mar-Vell\u2019s nemesis, Yon-Rogg (played by Jude Law in the film), and as Mar-Vell tried to rescue her, she was exposed to a Kree weapon that, essentially, turned her half-Kree.\nThough canceled two years later, it was groundbreaking for its expressly feminist subject matter, including Carol\u2019s fight for equal pay in her civilian identity. After the series ended she was a frequent player in \u201cX-Men\u201d and \u201cAvengers\u201d-related stories \u2014 most notoriously in a hugely-criticized 1980 storyline where the Avengers fail to recognize she\u2019d been brainwashed and raped.\nAlso Read: 'Captain Marvel': What the Hell Actually Is a Flerken?\nOver the years Carol assumed other hero identities \u2014 Binary in 1982, Warbird in 1998, and a return to Ms. Marvel in 2006. She finally became the official, undisputed Captain Marvel in a 2012 storyline too convoluted to summarize here, and, judging from the $575 million-and-counting box office of the film, she\u2019s likely not changing back any time soon.\nExposure turns Kamala into a polymorph \u2014 she can deform, expand, or compress any part of, or her entire body into any shape she can imagine. Already a huge Carol Danvers fangirl, Kamala calls herself Ms. Marvel in tribute to her idol and gets to work saving civilians. She must now balance the responsibilities of school, friendships, her familial relationships, and her cultural heritage while saving lives as a masked hero.\nShe\u2019s big deal for the Marvel universe, not only because of her powers and dope costume. She\u2019s the first Muslim hero to headline a Marvel series, and helped spearhead a serious push by the comics publisher for greater diversity and representation in its titles. And she\u2019s also the focus of some really authentic, genuinely touching coming of age tales.\nAnd before you ask, she doesn\u2019t appear in Captain Marvel, but she\u2019s had something of a mentor-student relationship with Carol Danvers in the comics. Here\u2019s hoping when \u201cCaptain Marvel\u201d gets its inevitable sequel, Kamala will make her big screen debut too."

Moreover, recently published scientific surveys by respected pollsters Gallup, Pew, Quinnipiac University and Public Policy Polling all find that far more Americans now favor legalizing marijuana for adults than believe in its continued prohibition. Why? The answer has become obvious to virtually everyone but our elected officials.\nThe ongoing enforcement of cannabis prohibition financially burdens taxpayers, encroaches upon civil liberties, engenders disrespect for the law, impedes upon legitimate scientific research into the plant's medicinal properties and disproportionately impacts communities of color. Furthermore, the criminalization of cannabis simply doesn't work.\nDespite more than 70 years of federal prohibition, Americans' consumption of and demand for cannabis is here to stay. Voters' recent passage of cannabis legalization measures in Colorado and Washington acknowledges this reality. These new, voter-approved laws intend to stop ceding control of the marijuana market to untaxed criminal enterprises and, instead, seek to impose common-sense regulations governing cannabis' personal use by adults and licensing its production. Unlike the federal government, which continues to define cannabis as an illegal commodity that is as equally dangerous as heroin, most Americans now recognize that a pragmatic regulatory framework that allows for limited, licensed production and sale of cannabis to adults but restricts use among young people best reduces the risks associated with its use or abuse.\nMarijuana legalization is no longer a matter of if; it's a matter of when. It's time Louisiana lawmakers to get serious -- and to get with the program.\nPaul Armentano is the deputy director for NORML, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, and is the co-author of the book, \"Marijuana Is Safer: So Why Are We Driving People to Drink?\" (Chelsea Green Publishing, 2009).

        "output": "are now available and the consequent drop in complaints to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman (TIO).\nThe changes will allow telcos the option of delivering on-arrival roaming pricing in a single text message, rather than multiple messages; allow customers to opt out of receiving usage alerts while roaming; and postpone the requirement for mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) having to provide roaming spend-management information to customers until January 1, 2019.\nIf a customer does decline to receive roaming information, their telco must confirm this via SMS and advise the customer that they may request to receive notifications again at no cost at any time, with the telco to comply with such a request \"as soon as is reasonably practicable\".\nIn February, the ACMA had opened up its proposed changes to submissions from the public, saying they would \"provide more flexibility to industry while maintaining consumer protections\".\nBoth Communications Alliance and the Australian Mobile Telecommunications Association (AMTA) welcomed the final roaming changes, saying they would provide flexibility for customers while travelling as well as delaying regulatory red-tape burdens for MVNOs.\n\"These amendments recognise that the customer protections built into international roaming products have improved dramatically in recent years, as service providers have committed to minimising the chances of customers receiving unexpectedly high bills,\" said AMTA CEO Chris Althaus on Thursday.\n\"Products such as data packs and unlimited roaming for a fixed daily fee have changed the face of international roaming, and contributed to the halving of roaming-related customer complaints to the industry ombudsman over the past three years.\"\nThe international mobile roaming standard was first produced by the ACMA in June 2013, and came into effect in September that year. It mandated that telcos provide travelling customers with roaming and pricing info upon arrival in a new country, as well as spend-management tools such as data-usage notifications and the ability to stop roaming.\nThe introduction of the standard drove a 65 percent drop in customer complaints to the TIO between September 2013 and September 2015.\nIt was to begin applying to MVNOs from May this year, had the ACMA's changes not been waved through.\nIn an effort to attract more customers, Vodafone Australia in February announced that it would be waiving its usual AU$5 a day fee to use normal monthly data, calls, and messages for customers travelling to New Zealand for the next year.\nWith Vodafone the second most-used mobile network worldwide, it could potentially bring free roaming offerings to all countries in which it owns networks, including the United Kingdom, Germany, South Africa, India, Spain, Czech Republic, Greece, Albania, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Malta, the Netherlands, North Cyprus, Portugal, Romania, Turkey, Egypt, Lesotho, Tanzania, Mozambique, DR Congo, Qatar, and Ghana. It also has minority holdings and partner networks in more than 40 other countries.\nVodafone Australia's Red post-paid plans offer AU$5 a day roaming to 52 countries, which allows customers to use their regular monthly allowances worldwide.\nOptus similarly charges AU$10 per day for a travel pack allowing unlimited SMS, calls, and 50MB of data per day throughout North America, Europe, and Asia.\nBy comparison, incumbent telecommunications carrier Telstra in December faced criticism from customers after making the decision to hike its global roaming charges during the Christmas period.\nTelstra had announced the decision to triple its excess data charges for many tourist destinations, but after hundreds of customers publicly slammed the decision, Telstra CEO Andrew Penn reversed it.\nAs a result, Telstra scrapped the previously announced excess data fees -- which were to increase from 3c to 10c per 1MB -- while maintaining the 50 percent increase in data allowances on its Travel Passes to a greater pool of countries.\nIn another effort to bring down international roaming prices, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) -- signed by Australia, the United States, New Zealand, Canada, Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia, Japan, Mexico, Peru, Brunei, and Chile in February -- is encouraging its member states to promote more transparent and reasonable costs for international mobile roaming services in order to support the growth of trade and improve consumer interests.\nHowever, it stopped short of explicitly requiring regulation.\nThe wording of Article 13.6 of the Telecommunications chapter [PDF], which covers international mobile roaming, states that members \"may choose to adopt or maintain measures affecting rates for wholesale international roaming services with a view to ensuring that those rates are reasonable\"."

But that decision came at a price.\nIn the Commission\u2019s original plans, the backstop mechanism would kick in after transition \u201cunless and until\u201d a \u201cfuture relationship\u201d deal provided better protection for the frictionless border.

In the interim, Catonsville Rails to Trails will complete construction on the 2.2-mile trail and maintain it until the 10-year period is up.\nThe 2.2-mile trail, which begins near the city-county line and extends west through Catonsville to the Bloomsbury Community Center, has been under construction since Catonsville Rails to Trails began leasing the property from the Caton and Loudon Railway Co. in 2006.\nThe nonprofit organization began by pulling out the old railroad track. That project resulted in more than 110 tons of metal recycled from the track.\nA \"huge amount of trash and debris,\" much of it from illegal dumping, was also cleared from the site.\nThanks to such efforts, residents can enjoy what county Recreation and Parks Director Barry Williams called a \"nice walking path.\"\n\"From Maiden Choice (Lane) to the Charlestown Retirement Community, the trail is really in first-class condition,\" Ajluni said. \"We've also made substantial progress clearing from Maiden to the Beltway.\"\nThe bridge that carried trains across the Beltway no longer exists, so where the trail meets the Beltway, walkers and bikers will take back roads to Frederick Road.\nAs part of its ongoing renovation to the Beltway overpass at Frederick Road, the State Highway Administration has agreed to put in a sidewalk after which trail users will take Wade Avenue back to the trail.\nWhile transferring ownership of the trail has always been a goal for Catonsville Rails to Trails, they hoped the county would agree to maintain the trail upon completion.\nBut Ajluni learned during negotiations that that \"wasn't really in the cards\" for the county.\nWilliams said Dec. 5 that he fully supports making Baltimore County more accessible to bikes and the organization's willingness to maintain the property for 10 years \"sweetened the pot\" for the county.\n\"In the past, the county would have said that we'll take care of it,\" Williams said.\nA lack of manpower and financial resources on the county's end made the 10-year stewardship necessary.\n\"That's what it took to really make it work for them,\" Ajluni said, \"so we were happy to do that.\"\nWilliams, who commended both County Councilman Tom Quirk and former Councilman Sam Moxley for their dedication to seeing the deal through, added that there was an \"intergenerational\" benefit to the trail, which starts near the Charlestown Retirement Community.\n\"I think it's a huge win,\" Quirk said. \"I'm a strong and passionate believer that we need to do more in Baltimore County to promote walk-ability and bike-ability.\n\"It promotes more of a livable community, and that type of community helps increase property values.

The entire southeastern half of the ArkLaTex has been hatched by the Storm Prediction Center. This means that there is a higher probability that if tornadoes form, they could be quite significant or a long-track tornado. The largest threat of seeing tornadoes would be associated with any supercells or strong storms that would be produced ahead of the cold front.\nAs far as timing, storms will start to impact E TX and SE OK after noon today.

        "input": "Is Marvel's fascist Captain America losing command of his fans?\nMarvel has had a tough year. Embroiled in controversy after controversy over its current Captain America storyline, the comic book studio has been in damage control mode since last July, when it revealed that their stars-and-stripes-adorned hero was actually part of",
        "output": "Hydra, a crypto-Nazi group.\nThe superhero was created by two Jewish men back in the 1940s, and made his debut by socking Hitler across the face, so readers were shocked to learn that the once proudly all-American Steve Rogers had sided with a fascistic terror group. This twist, which was masterminded by comic writer Nick Spencer, has run through various Marvel comic series, including Captain America: Steve Rogers, Captain America: Sam Wilson and the ongoing Secret Empire.\nAs Marvel\u2019s own in-universe history says, Hydra and the Nazis aren\u2019t exactly one and the same \u2013 but amid the backlash, readers won\u2019t necessarily have recognised the distinction between the Nazis and a proxy group founded by a Nazi (Baron Wolfgang Von Strucker). Petitions have sprung up asking Marvel to reverse the storyline. For months, thousands of fans have been voicing their shock and anger, complete with a dedicated hashtag: #SayNoToHYDRACap, where they complain that Marvel has \u201cruined Cap\u201d and had made him \u201cmore relatable to bigots who want to see themselves as heroes\u201d. And, more ominously for the studio, #boycottMarvel.\nBut Marvel doesn\u2019t see it that way. \u201cWe want to assure all of our fans that we hear your concerns about aligning Captain America with Hydra and we politely ask you to allow the story to unfold before coming to any conclusion,\u201d read a rare statement from the company earlier this month, promising that the comic would \u201cfurther prove that our heroes will always stand against oppression and show that good will always triumph over evil\u201d.\nSpencer, however, did not agree: \u201cIf we\u2019re really at, \u2018Don\u2019t put us through bad things happening in stories even if it all works out in the end\u2019, stories will not survive that,\u201d he tweeted.\n\u201cI\u2019m the most hated man in America today,\u201d Spencer told the Daily Beast a year ago. Some of the criticism directed at him has been vicious: variously charged as a fascist, white supremacist and even a Nazi, all of which are completely baseless. By all accounts, Spencer is a capital-w Writer with a capital-v Vision, and he\u2019s determined to tell a story he sees as important \u2013 despite constant calls for Marvel to change course and for him to be fired. When Secret Empire ends in August, maybe that will happen. Regardless, if he is still around, whatever title he finds himself on isn\u2019t likely to be welcomed by a large section of the comic-reading community.\nBut is all this anger really about Cap? Oddly, Marvel isn\u2019t the only studio pushing stories about superheroes-turned-fascists. DC Comics has two: their popular Injustice 2 tie-in comics have Superman as an ousted dictator, and the recently announced Nightwing: The New Order sees the former Robin heading up a fascistic regime with an anti-superhuman agenda. While some fans find these titles distasteful, there has been nothing like the anger directed at Marvel.\nSome of it is bad timing. The rise of the white nationalist \u201calt-right\u201d in the US hasn\u2019t helped Secret Empire\u2019s publicity, especially as Captain America\u2019s iconography has been co-opted by individuals who identify as members. While Marvel has done its best to distance its fictional hate group from real-world equivalents, it\u2019s hard for fans to think the publisher has their backs when their editor-in-chief says he is \u201cthe furthest thing from a social justice warrior\u201d and the Marvel Entertainment CEO is an adviser to President Trump. Currently the domain Hail-Hydra.com redirects visitors to the White House\u2019s website \u2013 perhaps the most telling indication of how Hydra \u2013 and Marvel \u2013 is seen by fans.\nAnd after months of voicing their opposition, many fans feel Marvel is not listening. Perhaps that is the most powerful factor in all of this: readers didn\u2019t want Captain America\u2019s evil turn \u2013 but the studio doesn\u2019t actually care. If Marvel can come out with a colourful distraction like the much-anticipated Marvel Legacy, maybe they will win some of these irate readers back. But comics fans have long memories, and superhero fans never forget. It will be a long time before Marvel recovers its good name among fans. They\u2019ve had a tough year, too."

        "output": "after the three who were implicated in the scandal resigned.\nErdogan had long ago announced that the cabinet was due for a reshuffle. But it has not stopped talk of a deepening crisis at the heart of the government - one that the prime minister is failing to control.\nIf the resignations had come just after the probe started they would have been more meaningful .\u2026 There is an impression among the society that actually what we have seen is the tip of the iceberg. People think there is more to the story.\nOf the three ministers to quit, Environment Minister Erdogan Bayraktar has the potential to hurt the prime minister the most. Despite being Erdogan's long-time ally, he refused to go quietly, saying the prime minister should follow suit.\nBut Erdogan insists his government is clean, and has dismissed the corruption allegations as being part of a conspiracy. He insists the probe is politically motivated and backed by international interests.\n\"The reason our party has been successful, the reason we took the helm and we have been ruling the country for 11 years, is because of our honesty, our commitment to the country and our determination to fight against corruption,\" he said.\nHe added that his AK Party does not overlook nor tolerate corruption and should it do that, it would be removing its \"raison d'etre\".\n\"We are facing an attack against the Turkish people and the Turkish republic, which is presented as a corruption probe. Everybody is aware that this is not a corruption probe but this is an obvious conspiracy, a set-up against Turkish politics and people,\" he said.\nBut that message did not satisfy many people in Istanbul. Instead, they held protests in parts of the city where they were met with tear gas and water cannon, when riot police tried to disperse the crowds.\nThe corruption case is seen as part of an escalating feud between Erdogan and a former ally Fethullah Gulen, the leader of a religious and social movement known for its network of schools in more than 140 countries.\nIn Turkey, Gulen followers serve in institutions that include the police, the judiciary, the media, even the AK party itself.\nAnd the party has benefited from its relationship with Gulen - who backed its members to three successive election victories. But the relationship did not last.\nThe rift seems to stretch back to a Gulenist prosecutor who tried to question the head of Turkey's national intelligence agency - one of Erdogan's allies. And more recently, the prime minister's decision to shut down Gulen-run schools was seen as a provocation.\nSo, what does the current crisis mean for Erdogan as he and his AK Party struggle for their political lives? Is the prime minister addressing the corruption issue effectively, and is he wrong to blame the present crisis on an international plot?\nTo discuss this, Inside Story presenter Dareen Abughaida is joined by guests: Yavuz Baydar, a columnist with Today's Zaman, Turkey\u2019s English language newspaper; Ozgur Unluhisarc?kl?, the Ankara office director of the German Marshall Fund; and Galip Dalay, a researcher at the SETA Foundation in Turkey.\n\"It does not have to be an international plot \u2026 The main perception among columnists in Turkey is that none of these people see this as a corruption case per se. It is like [a] politically-motivated corruption case.\"\nWe ask if an investigation into corruption is a mere battle of wills or if it can have an effect on Turkish politics.\nPolice fired water cannons and tear gas at protesters denouncing Prime Minister Erdogan's government over corruption."

Will it be a retread, a fresh talent or someone else?\nThe Star Tribune\u2019s Michael Russo outlined several key issues facing the Wild this offseason",
        "output": "in a great piece today. Of particular note to me, though, is the impending coaching search. This is the most important decision the Wild will make this season because the roster figures to be pretty similar (again) to what it was last year. It will be up to a new coach to get more consistency and production out of the same group of players.\nRusso tossed out several names of potential candidates and divided them into categories. I won\u2019t pretend to attempt to add to this list, but let\u2019s work through those names a bit in an attempt to guess what direction the Wild will and/or should go.\nRandy Carlyle: The 60-year-old won a Stanley Cup with Anaheim in 2007 and would bring a strong voice to the locker room. His all-time coaching record of 364-260-80 in more than 700 career regular-season games suggests he is a solid choice. On the other hand, Carlyle has also been fired twice (by Anaheim and Toronto), and his teams have tended to play better earlier in his tenure than later. For a Wild team that will be trying to win in the short-term, though, he could be a good fit \u2014 with the organization willing to live with the potential for future regression.\nMarc Crawford: Had a great first run as head coach, winning the 1996 Stanley Cup with the Avalanche. But that was 20 years ago, and his last three coaching stops have been far less successful. With Vancouver, he didn\u2019t make it past the second round of the playoffs in six full seasons. With the Kings and Stars, he missed the playoffs all four combined seasons (two with each team). More recently he\u2019s had success coaching in Switzerland, but he hasn\u2019t been an NHL head coach in five years.\nPaul MacLean: Coached Ottawa for parts of four seasons, making the playoffs twice before getting fired during his fourth year in 2014-15.\nGuy Boucher: Took Tampa bay to the Eastern Conference finals in his first season (2010-11), but the Lightning slipped from 103 to 84 points in his second year, and he was fired early during his third season. Wikipedia says he has a Master\u2019s Degree in sports psychology, which might be an interesting thing in the Wild locker room.\nKevin Dineen: Similarly, Dineen made the playoffs with Florida his first year (2011-12), had a swift regression the next year and was fired early in his third year.\nKirk Muller: Missed the playoffs all three seasons with Carolina.\nTravis Green: Has compiled an impressive minor league record but has no NHL experience, even as an assistant.\nPhil Housley: Minnesota native who coached Team USA to the World Junior Championship in 2013 and is a well-regarded Nashville assistant but again has limited experience.\nLuke Richardson: Another coach with a good minor league track record in the Ottawa organization. He\u2019s been a head coach with their affiliate since 2012-13, and he turned down an assistant position with the Senators to remain in that role.\nJohn Torchetti: A career grinder whose only NHL head coach chances have come in an interim role, Torchetti is a character who came in and did a credible job to at least get the Wild to the postseason.\nAs Russo noted, this isn\u2019t an overwhelming list of candidates in terms of strength, though one has to imagine the Wild would be able to land pretty much anyone from this list.\nI\u2019d consider Torchetti a long shot. The team needs an overhaul, and even though he did a decent job this season it feels as though the Wild needs to go bigger with this hire than the status quo. The middle tier doesn\u2019t excite me, with the possible exception of Boucher.\nGM Chuck Fletcher has tried two up-and-comers already for his two full-time hires (Todd Richards and Mike Yeo), and they have produced mixed results. But that doesn\u2019t mean he wouldn\u2019t do it again. One has to imagine that if this coaching hire fails to produce results, Fletcher will be out of a job, too. So he can feel free, in a sense, to pick the best candidate possible instead of feeling like he needs to go against the grain of what he previously did.\nThat said, this also seems to be a team in need of a strong locker room presence \u2014 a veteran coach that commands respect. Given what we know about the Wild, it would be awfully risky to give the job to someone who hasn\u2019t proven he can deal with NHL egos. In that sense, a retread with a track record in the NHL might actually be the best fit for this team.\nCarlyle would seem to be the most attractive of this kind of candidate, at least among those available now. His message might wear thin after 2-3 years, but that\u2019s the Wild\u2019s window to be competitive as currently constructed."

First, the car of New Hampshire winner Clint Bowyer failed inspection three days after the race. While Bowyer got to keep the win, he was docked 150",
        "output": "points. So in terms of the standings, Bowyer\u2019s \u201cwin\u201d was the equivalent of a 40th-place finish. Then points leader Denny Hamlin, the New Hampshire runner-up, took a dig at Richard Childress Racing, declaring that he\u2019d had \u201cthe fastest legal car\u201d at Loudon. That prompted a skirmish at Dover between Hamlin and Bowyer\u2019s Richard Childress Racing teammate, Kevin Harvick. During practice. But after all the bluster, there was a sense of same ol\u2019, same ol\u2019 by the time Dover\u2019s AAA 400 ended. As he\u2019s done in so many other Chase races during his four-year reign as champion, Jimmie Johnson ruled. He won the pole, won the race and scored maximum points. Here\u2019s how things shake out heading into Week 3.\nJohnson, of course, leads the pack this week. He climbed from sixth to second in the standings while shaving his deficit from 92 points to 35. Just as important, he ended his three-month losing streak and silenced talk of the No. 48 team\u2019s vulnerability. At least for now. But it was also a decent day for Hamlin and his Joe Gibbs Racing teammate, Kyle Busch. Busch held onto the third spot in the Chase standings while Hamlin shrugged off the controversy that had dogged him all weekend to finish ninth, his first top-10 Chase finish at Dover since 2006. (Third-place Joey Logano had the highest finish of any JGR entry.) Jeff Burton rebounded nicely from his fuel-starved 15th-place finish at New Hampshire to finish second and remain in the hunt.\nThere\u2019s already considerable separation between the top 8 and the rest of the pack. Tony Stewart\u2019s 21st-place finish at Dover made his fuel-mileage gamble at New Hampshire (he ran out of gas while leading at the white flag and finished 24th) look even more ill-advised in hindsight. At 10th in points, 162 points off the face, Stewart can afford no more missteps in the last eight races. Ditto for Greg Biffle and his Roush Fenway teammate Matt Kenseth, each of whom finished a lap down at Dover and now sit ninth and 11th, respectively, in points. Stewart and Biffle, at least, have reason for optimism this week. Not so Kenseth, whose average finish at Kansas Speedway in the Chase era is 20.7.\nRichard Petty Motorsports driver Paul Menard finished seventh at Dover, his first top-10 since July. But the most impressive non-Chaser was Menard\u2019s RPM teammate. It\u2019s not often that A.J. Allmendinger can call a top-10 finish a disappointment, but that was the case last Sunday. After starting alongside Johnson and leading 143 laps, Allmendinger cut a tire and went a lap downbefore battling back. Given his recent strong runs (eighth at Richmond, 12th at New Hampshire) and decent performance history at several remaining Chase tracks, including Kansas, there\u2019s reason to believe Allmendinger could spice up the title fight by scoring his first career Cup win before season\u2019s end.\nAt least Bowyer could appeal the 150-point penalty he incurred after New Hampshire. There was no appealing his finish at Dover, which was unappealing indeed: three laps down, in 25th place, worst among Chasers.\nWHY HE MATTERS: He\u2019s a two-time Kansas winner.\nWHAT THE NUMBERS SAY: He backslid from fourth in the standings to eighth after finishing 11that Dover.\nTHE LOWDOWN As the first of five \u201cintermediate\u201d tracks (from 1.5 to 2 miles) in the Chase, Kansas could reveal who\u2019s genuinely hot and who\u2019s genuinely not as the competition heats up. But this much is already certain: Jimmie Johnson runs well at intermediate tracks, including Kansas, where he has a win (in 2008) among his six top-10 finishes in eight career starts. Then again, Johnson also runs well at Dover and Martinsville and Phoenix and \u2026 it\u2019s no wonder he\u2019s won the Chase four straight times.\n\u201cHow can a car pass pre- and post-race inspection and three days later get such a huge fine?\u201d \u2013 New Hampshire winner Clint Bowyer on the 150-point penalty NASCAR assessed the next Wednesday.\nSunday\u2019s pre-race show on ABC starts at noon Eastern, followed by the race at 1:00.\nThe list of drivers who have averaged a top-five finish at Kansas during the Chase era is short. And if you\u2019re a Greg Biffle fan, it\u2019s pretty sweet. Even if you extend the criterion to top-10 finishes, Biffle remains in a class by himself (see chart). If Biffle is to establish himself as a contender rather than pretender this season, Sunday is the day to do so. Same goes for Tony Stewart, who has had two Chase wins at Kansas but has also logged finishes of 39th and 40th. For the rest of the contenders, Kansas is about survival \u2013 particularly Kyle Busch, whose average finish of 24.3 doesn\u2019t even place him among the top 20.\nAustin Dillon, 20-year-old grandson of Sprint Cup team owner Richard Childress and a rookie in the NASCAR Camping World Truck series, scored his second win of the season last Saturday at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. Dillon, who has just 22 career truck starts, won his first race at Iowa in July and is fourth in truck series points.\nKyle Busch\u2019s victory in Saturday\u2019s Dover 200 was his 11th Nationwide win of the season, a series record. Jimmie Johnson\u2019s victory at Dover on Sunday was the 19th Chase win of his career, most of any driver since the format\u2019s inception."

        "output": "senator was accused of corrupt dealings to benefit a political donor, Melgen, only to see his prosecution end in a mistrial in November after 10 weeks in court.\nAs long as Menendez repays the gifts, he is unlikely to face further official sanctions. But the stern reprimand stands to cloud his pending campaign for a third Senate term, though he retains an advantage as a Democratic incumbent in a liberal-leaning state.\n\u201cWith the Ethics Committee process now concluded, Sen. Menendez looks forward to continuing to serve the people of New Jersey,\u201d Elias added.\nAfter the mistrial, most jurors told reporters that they believed Menendez had not committed the crimes federal prosecutors alleged and a grand jury had charged him with. On Jan. 31, a judge dismissed all charges against Menendez after prosecutors decided not to pursue a second trial.\nIt was not immediately clear how much Menendez might have to repay. In 2013, after media reports detailing gifts he had taken from Melgen, he repaid Melgen $58,500 for a pair of 2010 trips aboard Melgen\u2019s private plane \u2014 an expenditure that, according to personal financial disclosures, cut deeply into Menendez\u2019s modest personal wealth.\nBut prosecutors detailed more than a dozen flights on private jets paid for by Melgen, and other significant gifts, including use of Melgen\u2019s Caribbean villa, a Paris hotel stay and golf outings. The Paris stay, paid for with Melgen\u2019s American Express rewards points, is alone valued at nearly $5,000. Their indictment also characterizes as a gift $40,000 in donations that Melgen and members of his family made to a Menendez legal defense fund in 2011 and 2012.\nTricia Enright, a Menendez spokeswoman, said the senator made an additional repayment of $46,975 in 2014 to cover other gifts and separately repaid the hotel bill. Elias said that after Menendez made the initial repayments, Menendez \u201chalted further remedial action\u201d at the Ethics Committee\u2019s request, including updating his financial disclosure forms.\nSince prosecutors abandoned their case, Menendez has moved to reassert his place in the Senate, taking back the ranking Democrat post on the Foreign Relations Committee that he temporarily vacated during his prosecution. As the most senior senator of Latino heritage, he has also reemerged as a strong advocate for immigration reform, including protections for the young immigrants covered under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.\nBefore Thursday\u2019s letter, Menendez appeared to be well-positioned in his race against a relatively unknown Republican challenger, pharmaceutical executive Bob Hugin. A Quinnipiac University poll published last month gave Menendez a 17-point lead and found that fewer than 40 percent of voters believed he had engaged in \u201cserious wrongdoing\u201d in office.\nFederal prosecutors, after media reports of Menendez\u2019s actions to help Melgen settle business disputes with the federal government, secured indictments on 14 charges, including bribery. They alleged Menendez used his office to help Melgen after the doctor gave gifts to Menendez, including the private-jet flights and stays at Melgen\u2019s Dominican Republic villa. Melgen also gave campaign donations that were funneled to Menendez\u2019s 2012 campaign.\nBut in court, Menendez successfully argued that there was no illegal quid pro quo, that Melgen was a bona fide friend and that the gifts he received and the favors he did for him were unconnected.\nThe panel concluded that Menendez\u2019s efforts to aid Melgen \u201cwent well beyond Senate norms\u201d \u2014 including arranging a 2012 meeting with then-Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius.\nThe letter also singled out the private-jet flights for particular scrutiny, noting that Menendez \u2014 just days after joining the Senate \u2014 voted for legislation requiring senators to pay fair-market value for any private-plane travel.\nWhile it is rare for the Senate Ethics Committee to investigate a sitting senator, it has broad power to investigate lawmakers\u2019 conduct, both while in office and beforehand, and it has taken serious action on several occasions.\nSince the committee\u2019s establishment in 1964, it has twice recommended that senators be expelled from the body: Sen. Harrison A. Williams Jr. (D-N.J.) in 1982 after he was convicted on corruption charges; and Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.) in 1995 after a lengthy investigation found evidence of rampant sexual misconduct. Both senators resigned before the Senate could vote on their expulsion. In that time, three other senators have been recommended for censure, an official rebuke that falls short of expulsion.\nSince 2002, the panel has issued letters of admonition to six senators. One was delivered to another New Jersey Democrat, Robert G. Torricelli, who was ordered in 2002 to repay a political donor after accepting a TV, CD player and three pairs of earrings for less than their full-market value. Torricelli subsequently abandoned his campaign for a second term."

        "input": "Intel Corp. agreed to sell a majority stake in its computer-security unit to private-equity firm TPG, partly reversing a five-year-old acquisition that has largely proved disappointing.\nTPG will take a 51% stake in the business in a deal that values it at $4.2 billion including debt, Intel said in a statement",
        "output": "Wednesday confirming an earlier report in The Wall Street Journal. The business, recently called Intel Security, will use the McAfee name originally associated with it.\nIntel&apos;s security business was originally known for antivirus programs. But it has branched into other varieties of software aimed at preventing attackers from breaking into corporate networks. In the first half revenue rose 11% to $1.1 billion.\nIntel bought McAfee for $7.7 billion in 2011 as the chip giant sought to diversify. It paid a lofty 60% premium, causing some analysts to worry the technology giant was overpaying and moving too far beyond its expertise in designing computer chips.\nThe move is now generally regarded as a disappointment. Intel, which has long looked for successful franchises beyond the chips for personal computers on which it built its fortune, originally characterized the McAfee transaction as a promising source of additional profits. Intel executives talked up the possibility of using expertise from McAfee to build more security features into chips.\nAs part of Wednesday&apos;s deal, TPG is making a $1.1 billion investment to help the business expand further and sharpen its focus, Intel said.\nMcAfee has drawn controversy lately. It took its name from co-founder John McAfee, an entrepreneur who sold his interest in its key assets in 1991. He recently filed a suit in U.S. District Court in New York against Intel, seeking a declaration that he has the right to use his name in connection with security products. Intel had warned him in a letter that his use of the name would constitute a trademark violation. Intel had recently de-emphasized the McAfee name in favor of what it calls Intel Security.\nIn April, Intel said it would slash 12,000 jobs, 11% of its workforce, partly due to the chip maker&apos;s failure to take advantage of the industry&apos;s transition to smartphones. The restructuring was Intel&apos;s largest in terms of the number of employees affected.\nThe continuing decline in personal computers has forced Intel to focus on growth areas such as computers for data centers and non-computer devices outfitted with data-processing and communications capabilities, known as the Internet of Things. Intel is also expecting growth to come from selling chips for servers and other gear related to cloud computing.\nLast year, Intel completed the $16.7 billion acquisition of Altera Corp., its largest acquisition ever. Altera&apos;s chips are used in an array of devices that include networking equipment. The deal came on the heels of several other major deals among semiconductor companies.\nThe McAfee deal would add to an active market for technology mergers broadly, a trend underlined by privately held PC maker Dell&apos;s combination with EMC, which closed Wednesday. Cybersecurity assets have also been changing hands. Symantec Corp. in June agreed to buy Blue Coat Systems Inc. in a $4.65 billion deal.\nThe sector has also provided fertile ground for private-equity firms, which otherwise have struggled to find chunky acquisitions amid competition from corporate buyers and tighter bank regulations that have kept a lid on financing. Year-to-date, private-equity firms have put $33.8 billion into U.S. leveraged buyouts in the tech sector, or 49% of all buyout volume, according to Dealogic.\nThe deal marks TPG&apos;s boldest bet yet on the need for protection from increasingly sophisticated hacking attacks. Last year, the firm led a $100 million investment in internet security company Zscaler Inc. and a $120 million funding round for security and information technology vendor Tanium. Unlike those smaller investments in relatively new technology providers, McAfee gives entree to a host of corporate customers and a platform to make additional and potentially larger deals in cybersecurity.\nTPG, founded in 1992 and with over $70 billion of assets, also has a long history of investing in units of larger companies, In 2005, it took a stake in Lenovo Group Ltd. to finance the Chinese computer company&apos;s purchase of International Business Machines Corp.&apos;s PC unit. In 2002, it participated in a $2.26 billion deal to buy Burger King from consumer-goods conglomerate Diageo PLC."

The next thing our eyes fell on was the frames hung on the wall, opposite to the painting of the caf\u00e9\u2019s logo and a motivational bible verse neatly written. The basic sign language and motivational quotes were the ones framed and that was enough for the light bulbs to go off in our heads.\nAlthough from the Tangkhul tribe, Khareimy was born and brought up in Dimapur and found education in, the Deaf Biblical Ministry School located in Naharbari, Dimapur. It was fate that she studied in that particular school because in few years time, it would be that school\u2019s principal who will introduce Hope Caf\u00e9 to her.\nFrom a very young age, Khareimy was introduced to various activities such as weaving, knitting and accessory making, thereby giving no room to doubt and unnecessary self-pity. When asked if she ever worried about being unemployed, her reply was quick and confident \u201cNo.\u201d Growing up she learnt that her hard work wouldn\u2019t betray her and that fuel was more than enough for the journey to keep progressing.\nTalking about her passion, Khareimy smiling from ear to ear, beautifully in sign language said it was \u201cbaking.\u201d Before, joining Hope Caf\u00e9 she worked as a beautician in Pune, however had to return home because of her parent\u2019s concern of her safety, which she obliged without hesitation because she knew her passion was somewhere else among baking powder.\nWhen asked about further ambitions, she replied about having none while adding on that, Hope Caf\u00e9 had been the door to her dream job. As she talked about using her talents for God\u2019s glory and how Hope Caf\u00e9 has helped her make it possible, she took out a bracelet and used it as an example to share the salvation. Here, she found delight at how she wasn\u2019t treated differently, which was the opposite back in Pune.\nThough Khareimy doesn\u2019t have the power of speech, her thoughts and opinion have counterbalanced it. One of her many emphasis, is the need for parents to never shy away but be a constant encouragement for their children who are physically challenged and mentioned that, till the end of time, she will be grateful to her parents for breaking the stigma.\nCommunicating with Khareimy was made easy by Akumla who works as a staff and interpreter in the caf\u00e9. Akumla also stated that Khareimy was very witty and knew how to handle crisis. At present, the Hope Caf\u00e9 has six employees who have hearing challenges. However, their impairment has not made the cakes they baked or the coffees they brewed any less tasty and professional.\nThe Hope Caf\u00e9 is an initiative by the Eden enterprises and Ministry with its founding purpose dedicated for the community often over looked, especially in terms of employment.

Maybe the Shanghai Cooperation Organization,\" veteran campaigner Lyudmila Alexeyeva quipped to Interfax, referring to a regional security watchdog dominated by Russia and China that is widely seen as ineffective.\nU.S. President Barack Obama won the prize in 2009, triggering widespread criticism because he had been in office for only nine months then.\nObservers and oddsmakers had said ahead of Friday's announcement of the 2012 prize winner that the Nobel Committee could choose to highlight human rights issues in Russia with the award.\nInstead, the committee announced that the prize would go to the European Union for promoting unity on the Continent, in what was seen as an attempt to boost morale amid an abiding debt crisis in member states.\nAlexeyeva, who co-founded the Moscow Helsinki Group in 1976 and turned 85 this summer, has been tapped as a potential winner numerous times.\nShe said that she was not offended by the committee's choice but that it would have been \"colossally helpful\" if the prize had gone to a Russian activist. She recalled that receiving the 2009 Sakharov Prize from the EU had given her a great deal of encouragement.\n\"The Norwegian Nobel Committee could have played just such a role. Sadly, it would not do it,\" she said.\nAlexeyeva's comments were echoed by fellow rights campaigner Svetlana Gannushkina, who said the decision was \"simply laughable.\"\nGannushkina, who has also been nominated several times for the prize for her work with Chechen refugees, told Interfax that the prize had been \"depersonalized\" by going to a bureaucratic structure like the EU.\n\"The Nobel Committee could have asserted the principles of peace and democracy by giving the prize to those who have worked in this field for many years and now need support,\" she said.\nShe also said the decision failed to send a strong signal to the EU, which she said has become \"rather indifferent\" to human rights and related issues in past years. \"They should wake up,\" she said.\nAnna Sevortian, the head of the Moscow office of Human Rights Watch, said that by giving the peace prize to the EU instead of to a nongovernmental group or to political prisoners, the Nobel Committee continued to lower the Peace Prize's significance.\n\"I would not say it discredits the prize, but it is certainly getting less important for people,\" she told The Moscow Times.\nIn a rare show of harmony, a senior pro-government lawmaker joined the rights campaigners in criticizing the choice.\n\"In my opinion [it] should have been awarded to major public figures for their bravery and nonstandard actions,\" said Alexei Pushkov, chairman of the State Duma's Foreign Relations Committee and a member of the pro-Kremlin United Russia faction, Interfax reported.\n\"To award it to an organization for its overall achievements looks unconvincing to me,\" Pushkov said.\nHe added that while the decision was probably intended to lift the EU's spirits amid the financial crisis, it was questionable given that the union, in his opinion, no longer can be considered a model for bringing nations together.\nPushkov cited the fact that racist and xenophobic convictions had risen in the bloc in recent years, culminating in last year's massacre in Norway by right-wing extremist Anders Breivik, which claimed 77 lives. Norway is not an EU member, however.\nBy contrast, a senior EU official in Moscow praised the decision by saying that it would boost the bloc's efforts to strengthen democracy in Russia.\n\"We are trying to open up civil society, the rule of law and human rights, and one can only hope that this helps our work here,\" Michael Webb, the deputy head of the EU delegation to Russia, said by telephone.\nWebb added that while the delegation's diplomats had not popped open any champagne, they were \"of course all very pleased\" by the award."

I began to wonder if the country\u2019s growing fascination with veterans and trauma reflected a loss of something cultural too, of the myths that up till then had organized our national identity. And if it did, I thought, then perhaps Americans were suffering from a species of collective trauma. Perhaps our civilian memories were as disordered in their way as those of our traumatized combat veterans. Perhaps those of us at home who glimpsed the war only here and there, in magazines and on TV, were as responsible as a culture for what we\u2019d seen as our soldiers were for what we and our government had asked them to do.\nThe analogy strikes me as a little too easy now. But it led me into long conversations with combat veterans, into thinking about how the plots changed from the first Rambo movie to the last, about Ronald Reagan and his attempt to reclaim the mantle of John Wayne, even about the rituals of the men\u2019s movement. I gathered these pieces into a long rumination, which was published as Echoes of Combat: The Vietnam War In American Memory by Anchor Doubleday in 1996.

Rob Shapland answers a reader\u2019s question on session fixation protection.\nQuestion: What is session fixation and how can I protect my users from it?\nSession fixation is a vulnerability caused by incorrectly handling user sessions in a Web application. A user\u2019s session",
        "output": "is usually tracked by a cookie, which is assigned when the user visits the page with the Web application for the first time. The problem occurs when this cookie does not change for the duration of the browsing session; users authenticate and log out, but their session cookie remains the same. This is often the default behaviour of an application.\nThis introduces a flaw into the authentication process. If a malicious user visits the Web application (usually from a shared computer, for example in a library), he or she would be assigned a session cookie. The malicious user could then record the cookie\u2019s value and leave the browser open. If another user then arrives and authenticates from the same machine, the malicious user would now have the session cookie of an authenticated user, and, using simple tools, could send a request to the Web application that contains the compromised cookie. This would grant the malicious user full access to the authenticated user\u2019s account until that user logs out, usually ample time to change the user\u2019s password or registered email address.\nSession fixation attacks occur in both vendor-supplied applications and custom-written applications, but are much more prevalent in the latter.\nIn certain cases, session fixation can be achieved remotely, which bypasses the hurdle of using a shared computer to complete the attack. This takes advantage of further mistakes in session management, and can be achieved in two ways.\nSession fixation is not quite the same as session hijacking, but both pose a significant risk. Learn more about session hijacking.\nIn the first scenario, sessions are not handled by cookies, but by a static parameter in the URL of the Web application. This is usually a long, random value that is assigned to a user in a similar fashion to a cookie. However, if this value does not change when the user authenticates, it will be possible to remotely fix the user\u2019s session. An attacker could send a phishing email to users of the application that contains a valid session identifier in the URL. When a user clicks the link, he or she will be taken to the legitimate website, but will be assigned a session identifier that is known by the attacker. Then, using the same technique as above, when the user authenticates, the attacker will be able to gain access to the user's account.\nIn the second scenario, the attacker takes advantage of a behaviour of applications that include the session cookie as a value in the URL. Some insecurely developed or configured applications will set the cookie based on the value specified in the URL, which allows an attacker to use the same phishing techniques as above to gain access to a user\u2019s account.\nThere are no tools available for session fixation protection; the defence is in coding Web applications correctly. To defend against session fixation, ensure your Web application developers code their applications so they assign a different session cookie immediately after a user authenticates to the application, and also verify they do not include the cookie value in the URL. By taking these precautions, you\u2019ll ensure no one can gain access to the cookie before the user authenticates."

Former Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Mac Thornberry, claimed that to withdraw from Syria or Afghanistan is to invite ISIS and other terror organizations to \u201cspring back to life.\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham claimed that withdrawing would \u201cpave the way\u201d for a second 9/11. However, a quick review of America\u2019s history in the Middle East quickly exposes those fears as irrational.\nThe first time the United States sent combat troops to the Middle East was in July of 1958. At that time, Iraq was governed by the pro-U.S. Hashemite royal family, and Iran was under the U.S.-installed Shah; Egypt and Syria were among America\u2019s biggest foes.\nBut Iraq\u2019s King Faisal, the crown prince, and the prime minister were murdered in a violent coup. Eisenhower sent fifteen thousand U.S. troops there in a show of force because he was afraid the coup would have a \u201cdomino effect\u201d and cause other friendly regimes in the region to have coups, moving them into the Soviet\u2019s orbit. By October 1958, however, the president concluded the danger had passed and ordered the withdrawal of the military from Lebanon.\nIn August of 1982, President Ronald Reagan ordered eight hundred Marines to Lebanon as part of a multinational military peacekeeping operation to assist in ending the Lebanese civil war. The military was never given an attainable military mission, however, and the objective of the deployment shifted over time. In October of 1983, tragedy struck when Hezbollah terrorists attacked the Marine barracks with a suicide truck bomb that killed 241 Americans.\nOn February 7, 1984, Reagan determined that while he considered the attack outrageous, expanding the mission to go after the perpetrators and likely getting embroiled in a civil war was not in America\u2019s interests and he ordered their withdrawal. Many criticized Reagan for his refusal to go after Hezbollah, but events proved his actions right: no more American troops lost their lives and the United States did not get bogged down in the civil war.\n\u2013 Before 1958 (when America deployed no troops to the Middle East) the region was very chaotic.\n\u2013 During thirty of the thirty-two years between 1958 and 1990 when no American troops were in deployed in the region, the Middle East was very chaotic.\n\u2013 Since we began our permanent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the region has been very chaotic.\nThe point should be painfully clear: the Middle East is a violent and chaotic place, and it hasn\u2019t mattered whether American troops were engaged there or not\u2014and the nature of the region won\u2019t change after we leave. Amidst all of this chaos, however, the security of the American homeland was guaranteed by our overwhelming conventional and nuclear deterrent.\nContinuing to keep tens of thousands of American military, contractor, and government officials deployed overseas in military occupations with no clear objective are not merely pointless, but they degrade our ability to protect the American homeland from potential existential threats that may arise.\nI have fought in large-scale tank-on-tank battles, traditional counterinsurgency fights, and foreign military training missions. I also served in Korea in the 1990s against the backdrop of a perpetual threat of large-scale battle, in Germany during the Cold War patrolling the East-West border between the Soviet Union and Western Europe, and served as the second-in-command of an Armored Cavalry Squadron.\nThe long-term effects of detracting our operational and training focus away from preparing for peer-on-peer fights since 9/11 has unquestionably reduced America\u2019s ability to fight and win major conventional wars.\nIt would truly be a tragedy if we had an unexpected need to fight a major regional conflict and suffered greater casualties because we were over stretched and over involved in small-scale combat operations around the globe that had no relation to our security.\nAmerica is not made secure by permanent combat deployments overseas. Its security is assured by robust global ISR regardless of where threats arise on the planet, and current U.S. deployments degrade our ability to fight potentially existential fights. Given these truths, we must not only withdraw our combat troops from Syria, but also Iraq and Afghanistan. The longer we delay taking these necessary steps, the longer our genuine security remains unnecessarily high."

After my first workout at the just-opened facility last week, every muscle in my body was singing.\nNo reason I should be surprised. Even though I work out almost every day, I don't generally do anything",
        "output": "like what I did there. Namely, push myself to the max on a high-end Pilates machine.\nThat's not all that sets Corus apart. Unlike those of its competitors (I'm looking at you, JetSet Miami), the workout at Corus was one I was actually able to keep pace with, and therefore to enjoy. I may have gone home a sweaty mess, but at least I went home happy.\nI credit Hillary Zashin, owner of Corus Fitness. A former representative of Beachbody home exercise videos, she's been around the fitness block a few times and has a sense of what works and what doesn't. What people want and what they definitely don't.\nHave a suggestion for an activity you think I should try? Send me an e-mail.\nHer first wise choice was solid equipment. No gimmicky, faddish devices or regimens here. The entire workout at Corus (corusfitness.com) takes places on the \"Megaformer,\" the luxury version of the tried-and-true Pilates Reformer machine. It's a tank, a giant surfboard of a thing with a stable flat base, handles and straps galore, and a sliding platform connected to adjustable resistance springs.\nOn this we performed just about every variety of exercise you can imagine, following a protocol developed by Sebastien Lagree. The class was only 45 minutes long, but in that time, under Zashin's supervision, we managed to completely roast my quadriceps, hamstrings, and shoulders.\nTo get that kind of burn elsewhere, I have to log some serious time doing squats, lifts, and pull-ups. Elsewhere, however, I don't get to wear fancy socks with grip pads (the kind you wear at SkyZone) or enter the studio via the coolest bead curtain you'll ever see.\nTwo of my favorite exercises: In a one-legged lunge on either side of the machine, we placed the other leg on the sliding platform and pushed back, scorching the inactive leg. Then, crouched on top of the machine with one foot in a stirrup-pulley system, we frog-kicked, using our hamstrings to drive the platform with our bodies forward and back. Just thinking about that is enough to make my legs tremble.\nZashin's other wise choice: music. At many gyms, the soundtrack is hit or miss. At Corus, on the other hand, you can make requests, and even if you simply go with the flow, you can rest (or rather, bust your hump) assured the lineup will be upbeat and energizing. On the day I visited, we were all about rock from the 80s and 90s.\nBeachwood, it seems, is becoming something of a fitness hot-spot. In the same plaza with Corus, at least three other studios are thriving, and several more are located within a mile radius.\nBut I'd say Corus stands out from the crowd. In fact, I'd say that for the time being, Corus has the melody."

        "input": "One of the silent killers attacking the developing world is the lack of quality basic education for large numbers of the poorest children in the world\u2019s poorest countries \u2014 particularly girls. Yet unlike many of the world\u2019s most grievous ailments, this is a disease with a known cure. We know",
        "output": "what tools are needed and what models are proven to work. We also know that the cost of that cure \u2013 perhaps $7.5 billion to $10 billion per year \u2014 is minuscule compared with the enormous benefits such education would bring for health, economics, women\u2019s empowerment, and basic human dignity.\nAn estimated 110 million children \u2014 60 percent of them girls \u2014 between the ages of six and 11 will not see the inside of a classroom this year. Another 150 million are likely to drop out before completing primary school.\nMore than half of all girls in sub-Saharan Africa do not complete primary school, and only 17 percent are enrolled in secondary school. Rates in rural areas are even worse. For instance, a 1996 study in Niger found that only 12 percent of girls in rural areas were enrolled in primary school, compared with 83 percent of girls in the capital.\nThe situation can be even worse for vulnerable children. In developing nations, those with disabilities and those affected by AIDS face even greater obstacles to education, while orphaned children are less likely to be enrolled in school than their peers who live with at least one parent. Only six percent of children in refugee camps are enrolled in secondary education, and opportunities for internally displaced children are even more limited.\nAccess is only part of the story. The other crucial factor is quality. As highlighted by \u201cEducation for All: The Quality Imperative,\u201d the 2005 Global Monitoring Report by UNESCO, too many children leave school without mastering a basic set of skills. Ensuring a decent quality of education is an essential component of reform.\nRaluca Ifrimescu, of Romania, at school.\nThe good news is documented in \u201cWhat Works in Girls\u2019 Education,\u201d a 2004 Council on Foreign Relations report that I co-authored with Barbara Herz, and is reinforced in a Mother\u2019s Day 2005 report by Save the Children: we have extremely strong evidence both on the high returns on girls\u2019 education and on what works to get girls in school. What is striking is the breadth of benefits derived from educating girls \u2014 not only economic benefits in terms of higher wages, greater agricultural productivity, and faster economic growth, but also health benefits, HIV prevention, and women\u2019s empowerment.\nTwo 1999 World Bank studies found that closing the education gender gap in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa would have led to faster economic growth between 1960 and 1992, while increasing the share of women with a secondary education can yield growth in per-capita income. Another 63-country study attributed 43 percent of the decline in malnutrition achieved between 1970 and 1995 to more productive farming as a result of increased female education.\nEven more impressive are the gains to health that come from educating girls. An extra year of female education can reduce infant mortality by 5 percent to 10 percent. In Africa, children of mothers who receive five years of primary education are 40 percent less likely to die before age five than are children of uneducated mothers. Across both Africa and Southeast Asia, mothers who have a basic education are 50 percent more likely than uneducated mothers to immunize their children.\nEducation has also proven to be one of the most powerful tools to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. A recent study in rural Uganda found that, in comparison with young people with no education, those with some secondary education were three times less likely to be HIV-positive, and those with some primary schooling were about half as likely to be HIV-positive. In Kenya, a study of 17-year-old girls found that those in secondary school were almost four times as likely to be sexually inactive as those who had dropped out after primary school. In Swaziland, a 2003 study found that more than 70 percent of in-school youths were not sexually active, while nearly 70 percent of out-of-school youths were sexually active. And school-based AIDS education programs have been shown to reduce early sexual activity and high-risk behavior. According to the Global Campaign for Education, seven million cases of AIDS might be prevented over the next ten years if all children completed basic education.\nIn making progress on girls\u2019 education, there are three things to keep in mind.\nFirst, while sending girls to school may be clearly beneficial both for the girls themselves and for their countries, in most poor nations it is the parents who make the ultimate choice on schooling, and for them this calculation may not seem so clear. Rightly or wrongly, such extremely impoverished parents often feel they need their girls\u2019 labor for extra income or, more frequently, just to help with the grueling requirements of life, such as the long hours spent collecting water or firewood or caring for the younger children in the family.\nThe good news is, when you reduce the cost and increase the benefits of sending girls to school, most parents will choose a better future for their children. It is critical to develop and widely implement policies that work to align the temporary interests of parents with the longterm well-being of their girls and their societies. The simplest and most basic strategy to reduce costs for parents is to eliminate the per-child school fees that are still charged in many developing countries. We know this strategy works because countries that have reduced or eliminated school fees have seen enrollment skyrocket overnight. In Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania, enrollment increased dramatically in the very first year after fees were abolished: from 3.4 million to 5.7 million students in Uganda in 1996; from 5.9 million to 7.2 million in Kenya in 2003; and from 1.5 million to 3 million in Tanzania in 2002.\nBeyond eliminating fees, even modest additional incentives to parents have made a huge difference. Scholarships and conditional cash transfers have been shown to lift attendance of both girls and boys in countries such as Bangladesh, Mexico, and Brazil. School-based health and nutrition programs have also proven successful. In Kenya, for instance, school meals were found to raise attendance by 30 percent and to boost test scores.\nReducing the distance children must travel to school is also critical because it both cuts down on the time children must spend away from home and alleviates parental concerns for the safety of their children, especially their girls, as they walk to and from school. Policies that both build parental trust and make schools more girl-friendly \u2014 such as hiring more female teachers, forming parental committees, and providing latrine facilities for girls \u2014 have all been shown to increase girls\u2019 enrollment.\nSecond, while it is crucial that countries make an extra effort and institute special initiatives to target girls\u2019 education, these endeavors will work only in the context of a broader focus on universal basic education for all children. Though the educational gaps for girls are especially large, the problems for boys \u2014 particularly poor, rural boys \u2014 are also dramatic. Furthermore, efforts to get girls into schools will never be successful unless there is a decent quality of education \u2014 respectable class sizes, trained teachers, quality instructional materials \u2014 for both girls and boys.\nThird, while the impetus for all major education reforms must come from the local and national levels of countries themselves, it is critical that there be a global compact that pairs a commitment from developing countries to institute necessary reforms with a clear contingent commitment from donors to provide resources to countries that fulfill their part of the compact. This is especially critical because the major cost for poor countries seeking universal basic education is the recurring cost of teachers\u2019 salaries.\nThe key to such a compact is certainty. Donors must feel certain that there is a commitment to good governance, careful monitoring, and national ownership of any plan to expand basic education. Leaders of developing countries, on the other hand, must have the certainty that, if they are willing to take on the enormous task of mobilizing political will and resources to seek universal basic education, then donors will live up to their part of the compact by providing the substantial funds needed to fill their financing gap.\nInstilling confidence that donors will live up to their pledge is particularly important in light of the multiple crises facing most poor countries and the reality that many of the economic benefits of achieving universal basic education will not be realized until after current leaders have left office. When the leaders of a poor nation consider taking on such a challenge even though the political payoff may flow to their successors, it is essential that the global community at least make it clear that those leaders will not be left without the resources to succeed.\nIn the five years since Dakar, there has been some progress on these promises. The world established the Fast Track Initiative (FTI), a new global financing mechanism designed to direct coordinated funding to low-income countries that have developed quality national education plans. As of July 2005, 16 countries had been endorsed by FTI, and an estimated 44 others could be ready over the next two years.\nFTI represents an important step toward a certain and viable global compact on education. Unfortunately, donors\u2019 contributions have to date been far short of what is required. As the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Governance Initiative reported, donors in 2004 delivered less than 10 percent of what is needed annually to achieve universal primary education.18 The global community will ultimately need to provide another $7.5 billion to $10 billion annually, above the pathetic $2 billion that is now provided in external assistance for basic education.\nWhile reform must always emanate from the local communities and national governments of poor nations, it would be inexcusable if educational and political leaders in developing nations were discouraged from taking bold steps to provide all of their children a free and quality basic education simply because they lacked confidence that donor nations would hold up their end of the global bargain.\nGene B.

Within days the government designated him an enemy combatant and he was moved to the brig near here and prevented from challenging his detention.\nAttorneys for Padilla later sued and, last December, the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in New York City ordered him released from military custody within a month unless the government chose to charge him.\nThat ruling was suspended until the Supreme Court considered the case.\nThe U.S. administration considers some terror suspects enemy combatants and says they could be held indefinitely without charge.\nThe justices did not address the broader question of whether President Bush had congressional authority to designate Padilla an enemy combatant or whether indefinite detention without charges or trial violated his constitutional rights.\nPadilla, described by authorities as a former Chicago gang member, is being held amid allegations he sought to detonate a \"dirty bomb\" and blow up apartment buildings in the United States.\nThe government said he proposed the idea to a top al Qaeda terrorism coordinator who has since been arrested in Pakistan.\nIn a dissent to the Supreme Court decision, Justice John Paul Stevens argued Padilla was an \"exceptional case\" that warranted the Supreme Court's jurisdiction and a ruling on whether detention was lawful.\nThe FBI arrested Padilla in May 2002 as he returned from a trip to Pakistan.\nIn a related case, the Supreme Court ruled that Mr. Bush had the right to imprison another enemy combatant, Yaser Hamdi, but that Hamdi had the right to counsel and to challenge his detention in court.\nIn a second ruling, the justices said that terrorism suspects held at Guantanamo Bay must have court hearings as well.\nLast month, The Justice Department detailed Padilla's alleged al Qaeda training in Afghanistan and contacts with the most senior members of the terrorist network, his travel back into the United States and preparations to rent apartments and set off explosives.\nThe government said Padilla sought to blow up hotels and apartment buildings in the United States in addition to planning an attack with a \"dirty bomb\" radiological device.\nDeputy Attorney General James Comey called the chronicle of Padilla's plotting \"remarkable for its scope, its clarity and its candor.\"\nThe department released documents, based in part on interviews with Padilla, saying he and an unidentified al Qaeda accomplice planned to find as many as three apartment buildings supplied with natural gas.\n\"Padilla and the accomplice were to locate as many as three high-rise apartment buildings which had natural gas supplied to the floors,\" the government summary of interrogations said. The alleged accomplice is in custody.\n\"They would rent two apartments in each building, seal all the openings, turn on the gas, and set timers to detonate the buildings simultaneously at a later time,\" the papers alleged.\nComey said Padilla suggested to his handlers that he detonate a nuclear bomb that he thought he could make from instructions on the Internet, or that he set off a dirty bomb that would release deadly radiation in a small area. His handlers did not think either was feasible, Comey said, and wanted him to focus instead on the apartment-building plot.\nTop al Qaeda officials \"wanted Padilla to hit targets in New York City, although Florida and Washington, D.C. were discussed as well,\" the summary said.\nOne of Padilla's lawyers, Andrew Patel, characterized Comey's information as \"an opening statement without a trial.\""

Many people can relate to this important experience of youth through either being able to walk to school each day because of its proximity or coming away from the school with significant",
        "output": "memories of teachers, staff, classmates and surroundings.\nIt is those kinds of important developmental moments the Amarillo Independent School District is embracing with proposed revisions to a voluntary desegregation plan that will emphasize the unique attributes and advantages of having a neighborhood school. Actions are specifically focused on the city\u2019s North Heights Neighborhood, according to our story Sunday.\nBy way of background, the original plan dates to 1975, when the district received a letter from federal authorities saying the \u201cconcentration of African-American students in North Heights schools were disproportionately concentrated in the black community.\u201d The notification prompted school trustees then to address the issue, which resulted in busing students out of the neighborhood to other schools in the city.\nOne consequence was children who lived near each other often did not attend school together. Neighborhood residents recently asked the board to re-visit this issue, and the board voted in December to approve changes, which now must be ratified by the Office for Civil Rights, the federal overseer of the district\u2019s plan. AISD officials say this could take up to a year, and the plan can be accepted, rejected or modified, according to our story.\nProposals address elementary and middle schools and should provide families in the neighborhood with more flexibility concerning where their children attend. For example, our story pointed out the plan includes an option of attending Carver Early Childhood Academy or Carver Elementary School (depending on the student\u2019s grade level) or attend school at the campus where they are assigned.\nStudents also can choose to stay where they are with transportation provided in a proposal that would be phased out over a seven-year period. Finally, students can transfer to a school other than Carver Early Childhood Academy or Carver Elementary or the assigned school by using the district\u2019s intra-district policy. Transportation is not provided with this option.\nAs far as the critical middle-school years, the proposal outlines a process where students in the Carver attendance zone can choose the feeder pattern they wish to follow. The decision is to be made by May 1 of a student\u2019s fourth-grade year. As our story pointed out, once students choose a feeder pattern, they are permanently assigned to that pattern as long as they live in the Carver attendance zone. Any changes afterward would fall under the district\u2019s transfer policy.\nThe proposals have gained traction with parents and advocates alike who favor an end to the busing of North Heights elementary school students. It is impossible to overestimate the impact of neighborhood schools upon the young minds that enter their doors. Likewise, a school that is just around the corner (compared to across town) adds to the comfort level of parents, who often become much more involved in the life and activities of the school.\nThere is no doubt that neighborhood schools breathe life into the communities they serve. The district\u2019s decision to re-visit and revamp its policies to serve the best interest of students and families is a great step that federal authorities should endorse as quickly as possible."

        "input": "Over the last several years the DA developed a narrative which saw the party targeting 30% of the vote in 2014, victory in both Gauteng and the Northern Cape and laying the basis for the DA to be part of the government by 2019. Naturally, this involved a great deal",
        "output": "of talk about the \"terminal decline\" of the ANC. Sometimes DA speakers got quite carried away by these targets and even started talking of \"winning\" by 2019 or, in Lindiwe Mazibuko's case, of becoming President by 2024.\nIt all made for an extraordinary spectacle: political parties do not normally give such hostages to fortune. The rationale for all this was, apparently, that the DA was engaged in a race against time before the ANC could effectively reduce South Africa to failed state status. The strategy which this implied was a frantic competition for the black vote, with concession after concession made to ANC policy - on BEE, on affirmative action, on using race as a factor, on the lunatic new land reform bill and even on surrendering the party's even-handed position on Israel/Palestine.\nTo top it all off there came the twice-repeated and utterly bizarre offer of the party leadership to Mamphela Ramphele. In this virtual stampede away from the party's old liberal stance, offence after offence was dealt out to the party's old core electorate in quite heedless fashion. The notion was that while this might cost the party some support, it would gain far more elsewhere. Above all, the party tried to make Zuma the issue. The party's Gauteng leader, Mmusi Maimane, suggested that the big question in the electorate's mind was whether Zuma was as good as Mbeki, with the suggestion being that everyone who preferred Mbeki (like Maimane himself) could vote DA.\nThis involved the party in reversing all it had said in criticism of the Mandela and Mbeki administrations - the arms deal, Aids denialism, support for Mugabe, the lot - and embracing the whole period of ANC governance up to 2009. This amounted to nothing less than large-scale historical falsification and the denial of the party's own heritage - a quite extraordinary thing for any party to do. In effect the DA was turned virtually inside out in this Gadarene rush.\nThe publication of the latest Sunday Times/IPSOS poll has dealt a hammer blow to all that. It suggests that the DA will poll only around 22-23%, far, far below the 30% target. With that, the ambitions of the DA taking Gauteng and the Northern Cape also disappear. The prospect of the DA entering government in 2019 then seems remote. The much-touted Ramphele, it appears, is so lacking in popularity that her party will score 1% or less. Perhaps worst of all, it looks possible that Jacob Zuma might even lead the ANC to a net gain, perhaps even a two-thirds majority. If the actual result is indeed anything like this it will not only mean that the DA strategy will lie in ruins but also that the party has turned itself inside out and offended its traditional supporters - for nothing.\nThus apart from the extraordinary breakthrough of 1999's \"Fight Back\" election, the DA has been gaining steadily, adding 30% or so to its electoral core at each contest. This was no mean achievement - one is reminded of the German SPD's steady progress through the 1950s and 1960s when the party spoke of \"Comrade Trend\" being behind them. In the DA's case this performance meant starting from a white, English-speaking Old Prog core, adding first white and then Coloured Afrikaans-speakers and Indians, and then slowly building a small but growing base among African voters. This in itself was an extraordinary social achievement for no institution in South African history has ever previously built such a non-racial coalition through the steady accretion of different groups. The result was a party which was far more truly non-racial than the ANC and, indeed, the real fulfillment of the Rainbow promise of 1994.\nBuilding such a coalition was not easy and ran right against the trend of racial polarization which the ANC has successfully ridden since 1990. As each incremental step was made, great care had to be taken to integrate and cement the new groups into the coalition, make them all feel at home, listened to, made to feel they counted. Moreover, most of these groups had no previous history of liberal belief and a huge job had to be done of inculcating liberal principles into their elites for onward transmission to grass roots. The strategy was, of course, at its most successful in the municipalities that the DA won, where all groups could feel they were benefiting from better, cleaner management. This, then, was the strategy the party followed from 1994 to 2009. In fact it was much the same strategy followed by the old Progs who had slogged their way up from having but one MP in 1961 to becoming the official Opposition by 1977.\nEverything suggested that the same steady incrementalism was the right path for the future. For it to succeed it was of critical importance that the DA unwaveringly held to liberal principle: such a diverse electorate could only be held together if there was a complete refusal of racial favouritism. As the example of the ANC shows, once one engages in racial favouritism towards any group, the non-racist strategy fails - the ANC may proclaim its non-racism but its clear racial favouritism has seen its support among the minorities dwindle to nothing.\nOf course, following such a strategy meant one could not set one's clock by the rate at which the ANC was destroying the economy. One could only progress at the DA's own speed. And that meant that the DA would probably only approach 30% in 2019. If then, because, against all expectations, South Africa's proportional electoral system was producing two-party polarisation. This meant that the DA's progress would become steadily harder because, with the withering of the smaller parties, virtually all DA gains in the future would have to come directly from the ANC. It would be a very hard slog. But, like the old Progs between 1959-90, the party would stand squarely for principles that it knew to be right and which gradually gathered more and more people in.\nThus the question is: why on earth did the DA decide to throw away this clearly successful incrementalist strategy and instead go for broke by a sudden wild bid for a major share of the African vote - which everything in its own past history said would be inevitably unsuccessful? The idea that the party could leap in one bound from 16.66% to 30% was pure wishful fantasy. Worse still, the party decided to throw away its liberal principles in order to make this ridiculous bid.\nEven if it had succeeded it would have had nothing more than an unstable rag-bag of groups which it could not possibly hope to hold together. For Mmusi Maimane, after all, the big question was which ANC leader do you prefer, Mbeki or Zuma? Yet there is no doubt at all that if you tell the old Progs and the ex-Nats of Gauteng that their real choice is about which of two ANC leaders they would choose, you will end up with a party split. Progress simply cannot be made in that way if the incremental gains of the past are to be sustained, let alone added to.\nHow did we get here? Part of the reason would seem to lie in the hiring of Stanley Greenberg as the DA's pollster. The fact that Greenberg had been the ANC's pollster since 1994 was a warning, not a recommendation. It is a basic rule of politics that no major party ever hires its opponent's pollster: in effect pollsters get bracketed as being either Labour or Tory, Democrat or Republican. This is necessarily so: a pollster shares the party's inner secrets and helps devise its tactics and strategy - not matters to be assigned to someone from the opponents' camp. The fact that the DA did exactly this in itself suggests a wishful leap of imagination, as if that step alone could unlock the secrets of the African vote.\nMr Greenberg is an able pollster, but look at the history. He helped guide Clinton to victory in 1992 but then in the 1994 mid-terms Clinton met his Waterloo: the Democrats were completely smashed, the Republicans swept both the House and the Senate; and suddenly Clinton was looking at the ruins of his presidency after just two years. Re-election in 1996 looked all but impossible. At which stage Clinton dropped Greenberg and instead hired Penn and Schoen Associates. Schoen quickly explained to him that Greenberg's entire analysis had been built upon a fatally wishful analysis of the 1992 result. Clinton had won 43% of the vote then against George Bush Sr's 37.5% and Ross Perot's 18.9%. Greenberg had interviewed Perot voters and they had told him that they were so fed up with Bush that they would have been just as likely to support Clinton as Bush. Greenberg told Clinton that this meant he had won fair and square, because if you re-allocated the Perot equally, he would still be ahead. This is just what liberal Democrats wanted to hear because it meant they were free to pursue a liberal Democrat strategy - Hillarycare and so on.\nPenn and Schoen said this was all nonsense. Perot's voters were natural conservatives and what they had meant was that they were so angry about Bush breaking his pledge on no tax increases that they might even have shown their pique by voting for Clinton. But in fact they hadn't done that and probably never would do so. So Clinton had won just 43% in 1992 and then again in 1994, this time with no Perot to split the vote, which meant the Republicans had won everywhere. The only way to recovery was to give up on the wishful interpretation of '92 and move to the centre. Which Clinton did - and won handsomely in 1996. The re-interpretation of the 1992 vote actually changed American history.\nHowever influential Greenberg may have been, it is impossible to hold him responsible for the DA's ill-fated attempt at a great leap forward. It is the party leadership that chooses the pollster it wants and then chooses whether or not to listen to him. Ineluctably, responsibility for the present denouement comes back to Helen Zille and her team. They have done prodigious damage to the liberal tradition and if that is to be restored much of their work will need to be undone. Looking at that team one realises that it divides into two groups: those too young to have much sense of the party's heritage and people whose main historical formation lay with the UDF.\nThe UDF was in many ways a glorious chapter in South Africa's history but its heritage is an unhappy one. It was energized by a feeling that it represented all the people of South Africa and that it must have no enemies on the Left. It had no liberal principles at all and largely accepted the ANC's \"struggle narrative\", a weirdly limited view of South African history and one which dealt in such dubious currency as \"struggle cred\". And it was completely voluntaristic. By happy chance it existed in an era when a whole array of political, international and market forces were all pointing to the Nats' downfall, so UDF-ites got what they wanted and were left with the abiding belief that if you wanted something to happen badly enough, you got what you wanted. Sound the trumpets long enough and the walls of Jericho will come tumbling down. That is, voluntarism worked. It was the very opposite of the sturdy incrementalism which the Progs had used to become the official Opposition.\nThe most disturbing fact about the UDF was that although it strenuously denied that it was a pawn of the ANC, in fact it was exactly that - as was demonstrated by the way in which the movement simply folded itself into the ANC without a murmur after 1990. This in turn meant that it would always toe the ANC line - hence its bitter enmity towards Buthelezi and the other homeland leaders, some of whom were obvious potential allies for an anti-apartheid movement. Worst of all, this meant a one-sided condemnation of (say) IFP violence combined with a delicate aversion of the eyes when the ANC or UDF forces themselves used violence. Thus the UDF engendered what Jill Wentzel tellingly called the great liberal slideaway, as formerly principled liberals began to jettison liberal values in order to adhere to the UDF line. Little wonder, then, that that UDF heritage has now produced a further liberal slideaway.\nIn fact it looks as though the DA will gain in its old incremental fashion - for the fact is that for most of its electorate the die was cast some time ago and the party's antics over the last year will not have much immediate impact. Once the election is over, however, there will need to be a serious re-appraisal and the question will have to be posed: if the DA abandons its liberal heritage, what identity does it then have?"

        "output": "cricket world is out to humiliate the BCCI. Like any corporate structure, the International Cricket Council (ICC), too, is money-minded and the reality is, T20 cricket has become the game\u2019s biggest money-churner.\nThe ICC\u2019s official broadcaster wants the scrapping of the 2021 Champions Trophy, to be replaced with a World T20. The logic is simple. A World T20 will have 16 teams compared to eight in the Champions Trophy. It means more matches, wider global coverage and a lot more money. Fatter broadcast revenue will, in turn, add to the ICC\u2019s bank balance and will subsequently come to its members. India is the host of the CT 2021 and a section of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) thinks that the proposed switch would result in a $30-million loss. It\u2019s difficult to understand how. The BCCI\u2019s issue is probably more sentimental; it\u2019s about forfeiting one of its own products and losing further bragging rights in the global body.\nWhen the late Jagmohan Dalmiya took over as the ICC president in 1997, the governing body of world cricket had funds of a little over $22,000. Three years hence when he left, the ICC coffers had swelled to $15 million. The Champions Trophy was the great administrator\u2019s brainchild. The idea was to bring in a more lucrative product between the World Cups. Dalmiya termed it as a \u2018mini World Cup\u2019, with only the ICC Full Members eligible to participate. That made the event even more competitive compared to the World Cup. The spectators and the broadcasters lapped it up, making the first edition in 1998 in Bangladesh an instant hit.\nIt\u2019s an irony that in Dalmiya\u2019s city the ICC performed the Champions Trophy requiem. \u201cThe Champions Trophy in a way was too similar to the World Cup; always quite difficult to differentiate\u2026 Why are you having a World Cup and then a Champions Trophy? It was difficult. And don\u2019t forget the 13-team ODI league is a huge step in making sure the ODI format has much more context going forward,\u201d ICC chief executive David Richardson said at the culmination of an almost week-long conclave.\nShort-form cricket has changed since the IPL\u2019s advent in 2008. Test cricket\u2019s die-hard support base has helped the format survive, keeping the \u2018obituary mongers\u2019 at arm\u2019s length. As for white-ball cricket, the IPL\u2019s rapid growth has made the 50-over format secondary with regard to crowd preference. In that context, the Champions Trophy might have become surplus to requirements. Then again, the 2017 Champions Trophy final between India and Pakistan had attracted over a billion eyeballs, attesting the fact that fans still covet marquee 50-over events. The inconsequential bilateral series has fallen out of favour.\nNow think about how Dalmiya had handled the present situation, if he were representing the BCCI at the ICC. Negotiation and persuasion had been his strength, and the master negotiator would have talked his way to a majority in the boardroom. N Srinivasan, another former BCCI and ICC president, on the other hand, might have browbeaten the weaker links in the ICC to earn votes in the BCCI\u2019s favour. Unfortunately, the Indian cricket board is leaderless and rudderless at the moment and its clout in the global body is gone.\nIn the grand scheme of things, though, it\u2019s not a bad development. A democratic set-up should thrive on equality. India might be contributing the biggest chunk of revenue to the ICC coffers and it is empowered by its legendary support base, but the BCCI can\u2019t work in isolation. The stunning Rs 16,347.5-crore broadcast rights deal for the IPL from 2018-2022 is not only about the Indian stardust in the tournament. The extremely talented cricketers from Australia, South Africa, England, West Indies and other countries handsomely contribute to the global popularity of the League. Similarly, Star India has paid Rs 6,138.1 crore for the Indian cricket\u2019s global TV and digital rights for the period 2018-2023 because Virat Kohli and company would play a lot of marquee series in the next five-six years. Without the overseas presence the IPL would become a glorified Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, while international cricket for India would cease to exist.\nIt would be ludicrous to think that the ICC is trying to take India for a ride. Without India the organisation would run on flat tyres. Which is why, if the Champions Trophy has to be scrapped, the BCCI should be at the forefront of that decision, not at the receiving end."

        "output": "not vented, yet they are still in great shape after nearly 30 years. Since the roof of the addition meets the side wall of the house, could the problem be that the soffits trap condensation because the gable vent does not have a free outlet at both ends? When we install new soffits this summer, should we have vent holes in them?\nA: Yes. The new soffits should be vented. Although I do feel that the attic is not properly ventilated, I suspect that moisture is also being introduced into the attic from interior sources. A typical source of interior moisture is a bathroom exhaust fan that discharges into the attic rather than outside.\nOn the exterior, check the roof to be sure that damaged shingles aren't allowing moisture to penetrate and that there are no open joints in chimney flashing, or around vent stacks or skylights.\nOnce these checks are complete, remove the soffit and push any insulation away from the eaves to ensure that the vents won't be blocked. Install polystyrene baffles in the attic above the soffits to ensure that airflow through the soffit vents won't be obstructed.\nNext, make new soffits with vent cutouts. It's important to prime the interior and exterior soffit surfaces, the endgrain and all cut surfaces before installing the soffits. This is known as backpriming. Apply a coat of exterior paint to the soffits, install the vents, then install the soffits. At some point, you will need to reroof the addition. When you do, install a ridge vent to improve airflow.\nSeveral do-it-yourselfers read our recent piece on fastener extraction and wrote to say, \"Hey, what about Spin-It-Out bits?\" Good point. These useful bits are made by Eazypower (eazypower.com). They have a 1/4-in. hex shank that fits nicely into a drill or a multibit screwdriver. At the tip, the bits have aggressive serrated edges that dig into stripped-out screw slots, mangled fastener heads or even a broken piece of screw shank. They also work on paint-covered screws.\nRoy Bellon, Oak Park, CA: Roy Bellon has been reading POPULAR MECHANICS for 40 years and servicing air-conditioning equipment for 30. So he seems well qualified to write on this topic. After reading our advice on cleaning ducts, he wrote to tell us of a likely cause of dirty air-conditioning vents. Rather than dirty ducts, the real culprit is dirt in the room's airstream, he says. A vortex forms in the air as it discharges through the vent. This imparts a static charge to the grille. The charge causes dirt in the room's air to stick to the grille. His advice: Use high-efficiency air filters in the air-conditioning system and clean the vent cover with detergent and hot water.\nQ: I found PM's recent tip on using foam sealants to fix a loose shower head very interesting. I use Dow Great Stuff a lot, and I really like the product. How do I find an MSDS for it?\nA: An MSDS, or Material Safety Data Sheet, must be provided by a manufacturer for any product that contains chemicals deemed to be hazardous by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The things it may list are the product's chemical composition, the dangers posed by those chemicals if ignited or spilled, and first-aid and fire-suppression measures. The MSDS for Dow Great Stuff Big Gap Filler, for example, states that the product emits dense smoke when it burns, and notes that corn oil is more effective than soap and water for removing it from skin.\nTo get the MSDS for this product, go to the Construction/Professionals section of greatstuff.dow.com.\nWhen a company does not post an MSDS on its Web site, contact its technical service department.\nQ: A branch fell onto my shed and put a big dent in the roof. How can I repair the roof without ripping off all its shingles?\nA: Whether you strip all the shingles off the roof depends on their general condition. If the dent is small, and if the shingles other than the damaged ones are in good condition, then replace only those shingles necessary to fix the roof deck.\nAside from replacing the shingles, you will need to make structural repairs to the shed's rafters or to its roof deck. If the falling tree branch cracked a rafter, attach a piece of framing lumber to it using 12d common nails in a staggered pattern. Space the nails about 12 in. apart. The lumber should be as wide as the rafter and long enough to span the damaged area plus 2 to 3 ft. on either side of it. To replace a damaged section of roof deck, cut out the damaged section to the center of the nearest rafter or install blocking on the rafter's side that will allow you to fasten the repair piece of plywood.\nQ: My home has a family room with a vaulted ceiling that runs to the ridgeline of the house. The room looks great, but it's hard to keep it heated and cooled to the same temperature as the rest of the house. What can I do?\nA: The most common way to deal with this problem is to install a ceiling fan. In winter, for example, heated air rises toward the ceiling, and cool air settles toward the floor. Depending on the room size and shape, it's not unusual to find as much as a 15-degree difference between the floor and ceiling. The ceiling fan can be used both winter and summer to mix air layers with different temperatures, making the room more comfortable.\nIt seems counterintuitive, but the fan should force air down during the summer because the downward airflow cools a person as it moves over the skin. During the winter, the fan should produce an upward airflow to force the layer of heated air at the upper level to wash down the walls. This will raise the temperature in the occupied area of the room.\nAn easy way to determine whether the fan airflow is up or down is to look at the fan blades as they rotate. The blades are installed on a slight angle. If the blade's leading edge (the edge facing the direction of rotation) is up, the airflow is down. When the leading edge is down, the airflow is up.\nIf you have a ceiling fan and find that it's not effective, you may be able to achieve better air distribution by having a heating-cooling contractor install an inline fan in the ducts leading to the room.\nQ: Can I adjust my Allister garage door opener? The door gets close to the floor, then goes back up.\nA: The problem may be due to a pinched door track, an improperly adjusted remote control or a malfunctioning photo-sensing device. A garage door operated by a pre-1993 opener reverses downward travel if it encounters resistance. Doors with post-'93 openers reverse from resistance and have a second -safety device, the most common being a photo-sensing beam.\nFirst, check the track. Disengage the opener, then operate the door by hand. If the door binds, adjust or replace the track. If the door moves freely, try adjusting its remote control. If you don't have an owner's manual that explains this, download one from allstarcorp.com. (Allstar owns the Allister brand.)

        "input": "Since we last met, the United States has chosen a new president. A number of the views articulated and policies proposed in the course of the campaign and the ensuing weeks pose significant challenges for Harvard and its most deeply held commitments. At the same time, eruptions of frightening expressions",
        "output": "of hatred, bias, and violence have targeted members of our own community as well as thousands more across the country.\nI want to say a few words today about how the University is responding to these new realities and to reaffirm our essential values and responsibilities as an academic institution in these unsettling times. I have distributed two messages\u2014on November 15 and 28 [both appear below]\u2014designed to begin to address some of these questions. The most recent message considered the possibility of more aggressive enforcement of federal immigration laws and detailed the heightened support and protection we are offering students, faculty and staff. I urge you to read those communications if you have not already. As an early and fervent public supporter of the DREAM Act, I feel particular concern about our undocumented students and as an update to my letter last week, I want to report that I have been in contact over the past few days with legal advisors, with members of Congress and individuals in the Executive Branch on behalf of these vulnerable members of our community. Our support for them is strong and unequivocal.\nOther measures and policies under discussion concern us as well. The resources provided for research through agencies like NIH [the National Institutes of Health] and NSF [the National Science Foundation] are critical to Harvard. Last year, we received $597 million in federal funding for research. We will be very focused on making the case for continuing and indeed increasing resources for research with those likely to influence policy in Washington. Sustaining this support is imperative not just for the work so many of you do but for the discoveries, inventions, cures, and engines of economic growth that arise from both basic and applied research to benefit society as a whole.\nAs you may have read, some members of Congress last spring requested detailed information from universities with large endowments. While it is unclear what form specific proposals might take, recent information from Washington suggests that this focus will continue with efforts in the new Congress that would seek to tax or otherwise constrain the use of our endowment [see this dispatch from Inside Higher Ed, with links to the underlying proposals]. This would be a matter of gravest concern as Harvard\u2019s endowment provides 36 percent of the University\u2019s annual operating budget and 50 percent of operating funds for FAS. We, along with other institutions, will continue to vigorously make the case for the positive effect our endowment has in areas such as student aid, path breaking research, libraries and museums, and support for faculty.\nWe are committed to attracting the most talented students and faculty from across the world. This means that immigration policies have a direct effect on our fundamental purposes, and we will work to ensure that Harvard remains an attractive\u2014and available\u2014destination for scholars near and far.\nAs additional policy proposals emerge relevant to Harvard\u2019s research and teaching mission, we will be engaged in representing the interests of the University and the members of its community. I anticipate that this work will consume a considerable portion of my time and attention in the months to come.\nAn early twentieth-century civil rights activist named Nannie Helen Burroughs once remarked that education is \u201cdemocracy\u2019s life insurance.\u201d I invoke those words often, and today I do so again in a spirit that goes beyond what Burroughs intended\u2014though in a manner I am confident she would approve. I would like us to think in these times about our responsibilities as a university to serve democracy by striving to be a kind of life insurance. There is of course the sense that I think Burroughs meant\u2014by educating students with critical minds, discerning judgment, broad understanding, and respect for their fellow citizens and for the rule of law.\nBut our responsibility is not just for the students we send into the world. It is for who we are and what we do here. Veritas is our motto, yet we find ourselves in a time where truth and facts seem hardly to matter. We must uphold and make the case for the commitment to reason, truth and the power of knowledge. We must be unwavering in the rigor with which we pursue new insights and test our hypotheses, and we must be open to the kind of debate, difference and variety of viewpoints that can change and strengthen ideas.\nTo create a community in which individuals dare to debate and disagree we must also build an environment of belonging and mutual respect. As a time when we read about\u2014indeed witness\u2014escalating incidents of hatred and violence\u2014ethnic, religious, racial and political\u2014we need to insist on a different way of being together. More now than ever, we must advance our aspiration to be a place where every member of our community, regardless of race, gender, disability, religion, or sexual orientation, can thrive by having the full opportunity to engage in all that Harvard offers. These efforts take on a deeper significance for those members of our community who have been specially burdened by the troubling rhetoric and events of recent months\u2014Muslims, immigrants, ethnic minorities among them. We must live our values and demonstrate what it means to be a community enriched not embattled by difference and diversity.\nWe face the future with new responsibilities. When I visited South Africa in 2009, I was struck by how everyone I met in that fledgling democracy felt a kind of urgency about the nation\u2019s future trajectory as well as a sense that what each individual did had direct implications not just for its success but for its very survival. Nothing seemed assured. In contrast, I thought to myself, we Americans seemed to take our government and political order for granted. This is a time of profound change in America, a time when we are called on to abandon such complacency. I have enormous faith in all of you and in Harvard as an institution to rise to that challenge.\nIt has been one week since the end of the most divisive and contentious election any of us has ever known. Whatever our personal political views, emotions run high and feelings deep in what for many is a challenging and uncertain time. And not just acrimonious words but escalating numbers of cruel and frightening incidents\u2014around the country, including on college campuses\u2014now threaten our profoundest national and human values.\nAlthough there is much about which we may differ and disagree\u2014among ourselves and with others beyond Harvard\u2014we must affirm the values of inclusion and belonging, and exemplify the respect for individuals and ideas that is the essence of an academic community. We must condemn and resist hatred, intimidation, and intolerance in every form. Working together, we have an obligation to provide all members of our community with an environment in which they can live in safety and dignity.\nI have necessarily regarded this moment not just through the eyes of a university president, but also those of a historian\u2014as a scholar keenly aware of how history turns on contingency, of how much what each one of us says and does matters. This is especially true in times of upheaval and change. We cannot shrink from\u2014or escape\u2014our responsibilities to both the present and the future. Violence, hatred, and divisiveness put all of us at risk; they put our society at risk; they put the very idea and purpose of universities at risk. In the face of such challenges, we must together demonstrate what it means to be a community enriched, not embattled, by difference and diversity; we must listen generously to one another across disagreement; we must model reasoned and respectful discourse and argument; we must all support those in our community who may feel vulnerable or under attack. And together we must use our capacities and our values\u2014our important work as scholars, educators, and learners; our shared commitment to truth, understanding, and compassion\u2014to help heal the wounds and divisions this election has so powerfully brought to light. Harvard has done this \u201cthrough change and through storm\u201d for almost four hundred years. Now it is our turn and our responsibility.\nIn my message of November 15, I urged the Harvard community to affirm fundamental values of inclusion and belonging, and to model the respect for people and ideas that rest at the heart of any academic community. Our responsibility to each other requires us to demonstrate that we are enriched by difference and respectful disagreement, and to support any individuals in our community who feel vulnerable or unsafe.\nIn the days since I sent this message, there has been growing concern about the effect more aggressive enforcement of federal immigration laws could have on many students, scholars, and staff at Harvard, especially on students who are undocumented.\nI write today to reaffirm our clear and unequivocal support for these individuals, who are part of the fabric of University life, and to share information about related University resources and evolving plans intended to ensure we continue to foster an environment where all at Harvard can thrive.\nSome have asked about the role of the institution in enforcing federal immigration laws. Last week, Chief Francis D. Riley of the Harvard University Police Department (HUPD) issued a message restating the HUPD\u2019s practice of not inquiring about the immigration status of faculty, students, or staff and noting that the department is not involved in enforcing federal immigration laws. This is consistent with the policies of the cities of Boston and Cambridge. Furthermore, the University does not and will not voluntarily share information on the immigration status of undocumented members of our community. And, as a matter of longstanding policy, law enforcement officials seeking to enter campus are expected to check in first with the HUPD and, in cases involving the enforcement of the immigration laws, will be required to obtain a warrant.\nIn addition to these commitments we will also be supplementing existing legal resources available to the community. The University will provide additional support to expand the work of the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinical Program, based at Harvard Law School. In addition to being a confidential place where members of the community can turn for legal advice, the clinic is planning a series of information sessions in the weeks to come. Along with expertise on our own faculty, the University will also invite immigration experts to campus who can inform members of our community about the potential implications of various policy options that the new administration might pursue. As circumstances unfold and as members of our community articulate new or different concerns, we will respond with appropriate actions and resources.\nWe will also continue Harvard\u2019s advocacy for government policies that advance the interests of undocumented students. I recently joined more than 200 college and university presidents in voicing support for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) initiative, which allows undocumented immigrants who arrived in the United States before turning 16 to enroll in college. These students have made\u2014and continue to make\u2014outstanding contributions to our community. I will make the case for them, and the benefits they receive as a result of DACA, with government leaders in Washington, DC, in the weeks and months ahead. I will continue my active support for the DREAM Act, federal legislation that would provide a permanent solution for undocumented students. Harvard was an early and strong advocate of both the DREAM Act and DACA, and we will continue to make every effort to advance their goals. We will also sustain our existing financial aid policies without reference to immigration status.\nFinally, while Harvard College and the graduate and professional schools have made a variety of important resources available, we will also create a single, University-wide point of connection for students and administrators seeking information or guidance around undocumented students and other immigration concerns. This work will be led by my chief of staff, Lars Madsen, and I have asked him to serve as a point person to coordinate these efforts across the University.\nWhile the immigration policies of the new administration remain undefined, we recognize and share the deep anxiety that campaign rhetoric and proposals have created for many members of the Harvard community. Their cause\u2014the opportunity they have earned through hard work to pursue their research, teaching, and education at Harvard\u2014is our cause. We stand with them as one community in support of each other, in support of the values we share, and in support of a commitment to inclusion and belonging that must be at the core of our institution."

You know, not every record you make is as good as it could be, and some of these songs, we just didn't get 'em right on the first go-round, and so we're taking another shot.\"\nThe show is performed by nine singer-dancers with a seven-piece band: 40 or so songs, nonstop but for an intermission. Mindful of three earlier attempts within the last decade to create a musical around their existing body of work--two that were staged in London alone and one in Seattle that was the loose springboard for \"Smokey Joe's\"--the celebrated collaborators are glad there's no attempt at wrapping a text around their songs in this, the largest such L&S-based; production to date.\nThere are plans afoot to take the show to a Broadway theater, the Virginia, this coming February. It's a long way to the Great White Way for what started out as a career writing semi-scandalous \"race\" music in the early '50s. It might be a fulfillment of a dream . . . or maybe just a half-fulfillment.\n\"A few years after we first started writing songs, we thought about theater,\" Stoller says. \"Even though we were both very in tune with blues singers and black culture, we were exposed to a lot of other things--among them, obviously, songs by George and Ira Gershwin, Cole Porter, Rodgers and Hart, Rodgers and Hammerstein, Frank Loesser. And we harbored a desire to do that.\"\n\"Still do. We're both very excited about this show, because we've seen some of the run-throughs. But this is stuff we've written before. People know these songs. I suppose that's good for the show, but we'd like to do totally new work, where all the music and lyrics stem from a book of some sort, that tell a story and become a piece in its own.\"\nW hen Leiber dismissed \"There Goes My Baby\" in front of No. 1 fan Zaks, it hardly marked the first time the producer-writers dissed one of their own perennials.\nOr certain interpretations. Most famously, the two initially had no love at all for the record that pretty much made them--Elvis Presley's \"Hound Dog,\" which cemented the Pelvis' then-new love affair with America and spent 11 weeks at No. 1 in 1956.\nWhen that Elvis single first hit--following such early '50s successes for the partners as the Robins' \"Riot in Cell Block No. 9\" and \"Framed\"--Stoller and his first wife (he's now married to jazz harpist Corky Hale) had just finished a three-month vacation in Europe, and their ship, the Andrea Doria, was headed back to New York when it smashed into another ship in the fog and sank. Fifty passengers perished on that voyage, but the Stollers made it onto a lifeboat, and their second choice of ocean liner was greeted at the dock by Leiber, armed with a dry silk suit (just in case Stoller was too soggy for a photo-op) and some surprising news.\nRecalls Stoller: \"He told me at the dock, 'We got a smash hit in \"Hound Dog\"!' And I said, 'No kidding? Big Mama Thornton's record finally clicked!' \"\n\"Hound Dog\" had been written for Thornton as a slow, growling, man-bashing blues four years earlier; the title came about when the writers were trying to think of a suitable euphemism for a certain four-syllable epithet that was too racy even by R&B; standards.\nWhen Leiber first heard Presley's version, he says frankly, \"I didn't like it. I thought it was too frenetic and nervous, and not what we had in mind. Certainly lyrically it was a woman's song, but after that, stylistically, it was a regional blues. And Elvis Presley's song was like skiffle mixed with bluegrass mixed with hillbilly. It was white Southern--it wasn't black.\n\"And the lyric was all screwed up! It didn't make any sense; it just had some slogans. It took, what--30, 40 years--and these slogans turned out to be monumental icons, whether they mean anything or not. And that's a lesson to learn about history. But I didn't think it was very good, and we thought it screwed up our original record, and then it sold something like 7 million copies, and we started . . . \"\n\"Getting used to it,\" Stoller says with a laugh.\n\"And before we knew it,\" adds Leiber, \"we liked it a little bit, and every time we went into the bank we liked it more.\"\nBefore then, for several years' worth of partnership, the two avowed blues-hounds had written almost exclusively for R&B; singers. Was writing only for black artists initially some matter of purist policy?\n\"Uh, no, I think more than that we just never figured on writing for white artists,\" Stoller jokes. \"I don't know why we felt that a white singer singing the blues was inauthentic, whereby we gave ourselves a pass as writers to write the blues and the leeway to be as authentic as we could be. I guess later on we started becoming less racist and decided we could write for white people too.\n\"But when we heard people say, 'Oh, \"Kansas City,\" that's an old blues song,' we thought we had really achieved it, because it was a song that we had just written.\"\n\"Hound Dog\" was written, to the best of their recollection, in eight to 12 minutes. Then there was the famous afternoon when song publisher Gene Auerbach--dismayed that they'd been indulging in New York night life instead of writing songs for a Presley movie as promised--shoved a couch in front of the hotel room door and ordered them to work. In the space of a few hours, they knocked off \"Jailhouse Rock,\" \"Treat Me Nice,\" \"I Want to Be Free\" and \"(You're So Square) Baby I Don't Care\" and then hit the town.\nSeemingly effortlessly prodigious as they could be, the two also latched onto another sort of songwriting formula that required a more painstaking attention to craft. After \"Yakety Yak,\" the 1958 Coasters hit, they began writing similarly styled tunes for that vocal group, musical-comedy miniatures with narratives and pauses and punch lines. \"Charlie Brown,\" they remember, took several weeks to write and rehearse, as they concentrated on getting the timing just so.\nAs Leiber and Stoller have sat in on rehearsals for \"Smokey Joe's Cafe\" (named after a 1955 Robins hit), many of the suggestions they've fed Zaks have had to do with the pauses and punch lines in these more comedic songs: \"There's more work to, say, one of the little Coasters vignettes,\" Leiber says, \"because it's more theatrical and has characters and dialogue in it, so it's like directing a tiny radio play.\"\nTheir decidedly unbluesy flair for the theatrical became more pronounced later on, reaching its dramatic apotheosis in Peggy Lee's 1969 reading of their European-flavored dirge \"Is That All There Is?\" ( not included in the peppy new show).\nBy the early '70s, they'd lost interest in rock. In recent years, Leiber and Stoller seem to have made almost a full-time career picking up awards--from being among the earliest Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees, in 1987, to getting a star on Hollywood Boulevard just two weeks ago--but haven't had much public output.\nThey wrote some oddball songs in the '80s, Stoller says. \"But we were no longer writing for the mainstream of the market. And we no longer had a vehicle with a record company to produce and put records out. As Karl Marx says, if you lose the means of production, then you're in trouble.\n\"But I think we changed more than the times. I know guys who are out there now older than we are\"--both Leiber and Stoller are 61--\"who are producing and writing records. We started before they did, but they're six, seven, eight years our senior. I think in a way part of it was that we started so early--we were actually 17--that by the time we were 27, we were old men in the business, in a way.\"\n\"And we also, to some degree, got a little bit bored or fed up with the rock 'n' roll idiom,\" Leiber adds. \"Because for us, it was a very limited form with which to express some of the more adult ideas we had. You may be able to bang out a 'rock 'n' roll' arrangement on a song like 'Is That All There Is?' but it's not appropriate.\"\nSays Stoller: \"We always wrote to amuse ourselves. And we were fortunate that when we were young, the audience that was buying records--who were in and around our own age--was amused too. But the audience for most records is still in that same age bracket, but we have to write things that amuse us now. And some of 'em may be universal in terms of age, and others may not be as interesting or exciting to somebody of 22 as to somebody in their 50s or 60s or 40s.\n\"To do it right, we have to find the area in which to produce these songs. And I would think theater's maybe not the only way, but probably the best way, to get off.\"\nThe two won't discuss just what sorts of original theatrical concepts they have in mind but seem determined to get something stage-bound off the ground. Which, should the collaboration resume whole-scale, would have Leiber and Stoller's professional partnership well outliving even most of the younger Brill Building collaborators they mentored in the '60s.\nSays Leiber: \"I know people that work in this business that write hits together, and they hate each other. Just like Gilbert and Sullivan hated each other.\" He pauses, possibly for grumpy effect. \"I don't think I could work with somebody that I didn't like.\"\nStoller looks up, beaming, almost too pleased: \"That's the nicest thing you've ever said to me!\"\n\"And it'll be the nicest thing!\" Leiber growls with a laugh. They suddenly engage in a congratulatory slapping of hands, then--as if veteran comedy writers instead of songsmiths--they start to go over how they could've made the exchange that just ensued funnier in its beats and rhythms.\nStoller: \"I should've said, 'Why, Jerry , that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me!' \"\nLeiber: \" I should've said, 'It's not Jerry, it's Melvin!' \"\n* \"Smokey Joe's Cafe,\" UCLA James A.

Miss Hughes went over to the WIn- dow and stood looking down into the candlelit world within the wooden box.

Seattle will then play five matches in October to conclude the regular-season campaign, including home games against the Vancouver Whitecaps FC (October 9) and the LA Galaxy (October 27).\nTickets to all remaining Sounders FC home matches are available through SoundersFC.com, all Ticketmaster Outlets, the CenturyLink Field Box Office or by calling 800-745-3000.\nSeattle and LA Meet for 17th TimeSaturday's match between Seattle and LA will be the 17th meeting between the two sides since the beginning of 2009, matching the club record. Over the past five seasons, the two sides have met 10 times in the regular season, four times in the MLS Cup Playoffs and twice in the U.S. Open Cup. Seattle is 3-5-2 all-time in the regular season and 1-3-0 in the playoffs against the Galaxy. The Rave Green won the first two meetings of 2012 by a combined score of 6-0, only to see Los Angles win the two regular-season meetings since by a combined score of 5-0, including a 4-0 loss in the previous meeting.\nSounders FC is 1-3-0 against Los Angeles in the postseason, meeting in the MLS Cup Playoffs in 2010 and 2012. The Galaxy took a 3-0 lead in the first leg of the 2012 Western Conference Finals before Seattle battled back in the second leg, pulling within one goal on aggregate before Robbie Keane converted a penalty kick to help LA back to the MLS Cup final.\nClash of National Team StarsSaturday's Seattle-LA matchup will feature several international stars. In addition to Seattle's Eddie Johnson, Clint Dempsey and Brad Evans, the Galaxy's attack is led by U.S. legend Landon Donovan and Irish captain Robbie Keane, and USMNT center back Omar Gonzalez shores up the backline.\nDonovan-the USMNT all-time leader in starts, goals and assists-is second on the Galaxy with eight goals and eight assists in 2013, including six goals and five assists in his last nine appearances, highlighted by a hat trick against Dallas on August 11. With 132 career goals, the 31-year-old is two goals shy of Jeff Cunningham's all-time MLS record. Donovan's next game will be the 300th of his MLS career.\nKeane, one of the league's most prolific strikers, ranks in the top five with 13 goals (4th) and 11 assists (3rd) in just 17 games this season. Arguably the most efficient attacker in MLS, his 0.78 goals per 90 minutes ranks second and his 0.66 assists per 90 minutes ranks first. The 33-year-old has 31 goals and 21 assists in just 49 games since joining the league late in 2011."

        "output": "from its four-nozzle first stage engine.\nThe 20-story, million-pound rocket pitched eastward and headed downrange from the Odyssey launch pad, a floating platform positioned in equatorial waters of the Pacific, about 1,400 miles south of Hawaii.\nThe two Ukrainian-made lower stages of the Zenit performed their firings to propel the Russian Block DM-SL upper stage and satellite out of the atmosphere during the initial eight-and-a-half minutes of flight.\nThe upper stage then took over, completing an initial engine burn to reach a preliminary orbit less than 14 minutes after launch. The rocket coasted for a half-hour, flying over South America, before re-igniting for a seven-minute firing to accelerate the payload into an elliptical geosynchronous transfer orbit with a high point of 22,149 miles and low point of 466 miles.\nRestraints holding the 12,150-pound satellite to the spent rocket motor were released over the western Indian Ocean, allowing the payload to separate and begin its 15-year mission in space.\n\"What a great launch,\" said Kjell Karlsen, the newly appointed president and general manager of Sea Launch. \"This is my first launch as president. My knees are still shaking.\"\nThe satellite will use an onboard engine to reach a circular geostationary orbit 22,300 miles above the equator where it can match Earth's rotation and seem parked over one spot of the globe. Its final destination will be the slot at 110 degrees West longitude to cover the United States.\nBuilt by Space Systems/Loral of Palo Alto, California, the craft is equipped with Ku-band transponders to relay direct-to-home TV programming for DISH Network.\n\"EchoStar 11 is a powerful 20-kW satellite, designed to expand capacity for DISH Network,\" said John Celli, president and chief operating officer of Space Systems/Loral.\n\"The real significance of this satellite for us is it's truly going to add a lot of capability,\" said Rohan Zaveri, vice president of space programs for DISH Network. \"What we are really going to get is the ability to deliver more programming, more choices to our customers. We are going to do that because the satellite actually has the ability give us more power.\"\n\"At Space Systems/Loral, we are the leader in high-power satellite technology. So this is one of the prime examples of how the high-power aspects of a satellite, as well as the high-performance payload, benefit an application like direct broadcasting of TV signals,\" said Hampton Chan, Space Systems/Loral's executive director of advanced programs and space systems.\nDISH customers are anxiously awaiting the new satellite's entrance into service. Earlier this year, the AMERICOM 14 spacecraft that would have provided its capacity to the direct broadcast system under a lease deal was lost in a Russian Proton rocket failure.\nBut today's rocket flight appeared smooth, and ground controllers established contact with EchoStar 11 via a tracking station in Australia right as planned. It marked the third time Sea Launch had deployed an EchoStar satellite, following EchoStar 9 in 2003 and EchoStar 10 in 2006.\n\"We're proud of our role in DISH Network's continued success. We thank you for your continued trust and confidence in our system and our team,\" Karlsen said.\nSpaceflight Now visited Sea Launch one week before Odyssey set sail to begin the EchoStar 11 launch campaign. See our exclusive photo galley here and an overview of Sea Launch operations here.\nThis is a busy year for Sea Launch, now having completed four flights and another two slated to occur in the coming months. Next up will be the launch of the Galaxy 19 telecommunications satellite for Intelsat.\nIn addition, officials anticipate conducting one or two missions using the company's Land Launch subsidiary from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan by year's end."

That's down from 9.6 per cent the previous quarter, but wow, it still must represent a lot of infections.\nThe infection rate for mobile devices is up from last quarter, to 0.55 per",
        "output": "cent. That figure may seem low, but Kindsight estimates that it represents 11.6 million mobile devices infected with malware at any given time. Over 60 per cent of those are Android devices.\nAt the start of 2013, Windows devices with a mobile connection made up over 60 per cent of the infected mobile devices detected by Kindsight. By the end of the year, Android had taken the lead, and not just by a little bit. December's figures show Android at well over 60 per cent of the total. As for BlackBerry, iOS, Symbian, and Windows Phone, well, taken all together they still don't come to one per cent of the total.\nThe report calls Android \"the Windows XP of mobile,\" and notes several reasons that Android is the preferred platform for mobile malware. First, it has the biggest mobile market share, and hence the biggest number of potential victims. Second, users can load any program on an Android device if they're willing to use a non-approved app store. Third, Trojanising an Android app is ridiculously simple. I can attest to that; I've seen it done in less than five minutes.\nThe number of Android malware samples in Kindsight's database grew by a factor of 20 during 2013. However, that doesn't actually mean there are 20 times as many distinct malicious payloads. Trojanised apps are by far the most common type of Android malware. To get maximum coverage, an attacker will add precisely the same malicious code to as many apps as possible. The report states: \"Often we will discover a third-party app store distributing a single malware type disguised as hundreds of different wallpaper apps.\"\nThe report does note that generally speaking, mobile malware seriously lags behind Windows malware in terms of sophistication, stating that: \"A lot of Android malware is currently fairly na\u00efve and simplistic in its design and operation.\" Many Windows-based botnets can \"rally\" to a new command and control server if their existing one gets knocked offline. Some, like ZeroAccess and GameOver Zeus, transmit commands via peer-to-peer networks, with no central server. Mobile botnets, on the other hand, tend to use a single, hard-coded IP address for command and control. Take out that server and the botnet is dead.\nThe full report, available to download here, offers more information than I can begin to summarise. It charts the most common infestations for home networks and Android devices, for example, and separately charts those with a high threat level. It describes the more interesting ones in detail.\nWhat's coming in 2014? Kindsight suggests that cyber-crooks will move to mobile malware only if they can see a profit in it, either due to new opportunities opening or old cash sources drying up. Mobile malware can be incredibly useful in advanced persistent threat attacks or cyber-espionage. Plant a spy app on a victim's phone and you can track him anywhere, slurp down personal info, and circumvent network security at his workplace.\nMobile danger doesn't have to come in the form of malware. \"Imagine an underground hacktivism organisation that provided their own app for Android and iPhone,\" suggests the report. Its authors go so far as to posit an \"Occupy the Internet\" movement. Will it happen? We'll certainly find out."

Scrolling through my app looking for something to cast onto my television it recommended that I would like a show called \u201cHappy!\u201d The preview image",
        "output": "grabbed me and the synopsis was bizarre enough to peak my interests \u2013 \u201cA boozy ex-cop turned hit man thinks he\u2019s losing his marbles when a cartoon unicorn only he can see urges him to rescue a girl kidnapped by Santa.\u201d So I looked up a trailer and it said it was based on a graphic novel, so I looked that graphic novel up and two words sold me on it: \u201cGrant Morrison.\u201d Needless to say that I binged the show pretty quickly.\nThe Syfy/Netflix show \u2018Happy!\u2019 has a surreal bizarreness that you adapt to quickly. It\u2019s sort of like if you took Sin City, Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, and My Little Pony and put them into a blender. It\u2019s extremely graphically violent, hilarious at points, and surprisingly charmingly sweet. Plus, aside from what is discussed in this article it also has a Strega character and there are hints at themes of necromancy and spirit possession.\nI\u2019m going to try hard to not spoil the story too much for those who haven\u2019t watched the show yet or read the graphic novel that it\u2019s based upon. Essentially, Happy is the self-identified imaginary friend of a little girl named Hailey who seeks out Nick Sax to rescue her. Despite seeming like a hallucination of Nick\u2019s mind, it soon becomes evident that this is something more than a hallucination. Happy can do things like check to see how many people are coming, reveal the cards others are holding during poker to Nick, and other surprising traits that rule out the idea that it\u2019s a figment of Nick\u2019s imagination \u2013 as Happy can know things that Nick doesn\u2019t. Furthermore, children and a crack-smoking nutcase dressed as Santa can also perceive Happy. We see something else very interesting when Happy begins losing his hair, dulling in color, and slowly falling apart when Hailey begins losing hope that Happy is going to help save her.\nWhile watching the show I quickly concluded that Happy was an artificial servitor spirit. An artificial servitor spirit (sometimes referred to classically as a \u2018thought-form\u2019) in occultism was first popularized in Theosophy and embraced in occultism, though it can vary from being sentient and having a form to sort of energy blobs that affect a person. Essentially, a thought-form in the sense of an \u201cartificial servitor spirit\u201d, is a form that is sculpted using mental, emotional, and astral energies of the occultist which then begin to take on an autonomous personality of its own. Artificial servitor spirits are often used to perform certain tasks, fetch things, or protect. They can usually be perceived by psychics outside of the creator. The idea is similar but different to concepts of egregores (or godforms), which are created and maintained by groups which become a sort of vessel into which a spirit or deity can enter into and empower.\nI assumed that the similarities between this \u201cimaginary friend\u201d and the characteristics portrayed by Happy must be intentional since it\u2019s Grant Morrison who wrote it. Grant Morrison is completely out of his mind in the best way possible. Grant Morrison is not only well-known in comic circles but also occult circles. As a practicing chaos magician, Grant Morrison often weaves in occult and metaphysical ideas into his works.\nI decided to check out the graphic novel and was struck by what appears to be concept art for Happy, where he looks exactly like a pony from My Little Pony. I randomly searched the internet for My Little Pony and thought-forms and discovered that there\u2019s a whole subculture marriage of people who are creating thought-forms based off of My Little Pony. The first group of people are called \u201ctulpamancers\u201d who perform \u201ctulpamancy\u201d and refer to their thoughtforms as \u201ctulpas\u201d, which is a misunderstanding of the term as we\u2019ll see later on. As of today there are over 22 thousand members of the r/Tulpas subreddit forum.\nThe second subculture are \u201cbronies.\u201d Bronies are adult male fans of My Little Pony. Somehow the two subcultures cross-pollinated and we now have a whole area of the internet where people are discussing their pony tulpas they\u2019ve created. While not all brony tulpamancers are into it, a large portion seem to be creating their brony tulpas for sexual or romantic purposes. Whether Grant Morrison was conscious of this or not, it\u2019s interesting to see that there\u2019s also a sort of furry kink underground in \u2018Happy!\u2019 too, though they\u2019re insects. Furries are people who dress up or identify as cartoon anthropomorphic animals and just like the brony tulpamancers, there\u2019s a large portion that of the subculture that use it as a kink. We also see the parallel of a little girl\u2019s imaginary friend and an adult male pairing up, just as My Little Pony was and is meant for little girls as their demographic yet has an unexpected adult male following.\nWhile I\u2019m not inherently against bronies, I am a little bit concerned about this. I mean, if they\u2019re not harming anyone they can be fans of whatever they want \u2013 and I say more power to them. Different strokes for different folks. But as someone who teaches workshops on artificial servitors, I am a bit troubled by this tulpa phenomenon. The reason being is that the directions often provided in these groups to create the tulpa are not wise. That isn\u2019t to say that they\u2019re incorrect or that people shouldn\u2019t or can\u2019t make My Little Pony thoughtforms. But how they\u2019re going about it is a bit unwise.\nIf an artificial servitor spirit is successfully created, it can be hard to control and even turn against the creator if made shoddily. Like any form of magick, one wants to ensure that they have every base covered. When making an artificial servitor spirit, one should have a fair amount of magickal will and training before attempting the task and more importantly clear and concise directions should be programmed into the servitor spirit \u2013 including a self-destruct or dismantling command. Most occultists who\u2019ve worked with artificial servitor spirits have stories about their experiments getting out of hand before getting the hang on creation.\nDespite the use of the word \u201ctulpa\u201d I know from other occultists who are more familiar with Tibetan Buddhism and Tibetan Sorcery that a tulpa isn\u2019t equivalent to a thought-form. So I reached out to author and occultist Jason Miller, whom I know is trained in these areas and has spent time in Nepal to ask him what a tulpa actually was.\n\u201c\u201dMystiques et Magiciens du Tibet\u201d was the name of the book that Alexandria David Neel wrote in 1928, published in 1931 as \u201cWith Mystics and Magicians in Tibet\u201d in English. In that book Neel details her experiment making what we call today a servitor, and what she called a \u201cTulpa\u201d. Because she did not want to be influenced by the \u201cforms of the Lamaist Deities\u201d which she saw around her in paintings and images she decided to create a short fat jolly monk. She shut herself up for several months and formed the phantom monk, which supposedly did the things normal travelers did and was occasionally seen by members of their traveling party.\nEventually, though the Monk became gaunt and mean. In her words, the experience turned into a \u201cdaynightmare\u201d. She decided to dissolve the Tulpa before making her trip to Lhasa, but the creature fought back. According to her book, it took her six months of hard struggle to dissolve the Tulpa.\nIt is this story, now 85 years old, that gets referred to time and time again in any book that mentions Tulpas. When I started my study of Tibetan Buddhism, with an emphasis on sorcerous practices, of course, I found it quite odd that occultists keep going back to this story from the 1920s. At the time it was written Tibet was closed to outsiders and there was very little information available, but today it is 50 years after the Chinese invasion of Tibet and there are Lamas, monasteries, dharma centers, and teachers all over the western world. There are thousands of books by actual Tibetan detailing the once-secret practices of Tibetan magic and mysticism \u2013 so why then are we relying upon an 85-year-old account from a foreigner as the primary source for information on Tulpas?\nAll of those books are wrong.\nNow before you e-mail me the Wikipedia page showing that Tulpa is a real word, let me assure you that certainly, the word Tulpa is a real word. It even translates as \u201cmind emanation\u201d so the confusion is understandable. In Tibetan Buddhism this mind emanation is not a created spirit though, it gets used in other ways.\nIn some cases, the term is used for when a great Siddha emanates a body that his own consciousness would inhabit. In terms of western occultism, this is more like an astral body than a servitor. Such was the case when Garab Dorje\u2019s mother thought he was a Nirmita (Tulpa) because his body was indestructible. This body, however, is visible to the naked eye, not an invisible astral projection, and certainly not a made up construction brought to consciousness through magic.\nIn the Dzogchen classic, Nang Jang, the author uses the example of a Tulpa for pointing out how reality arises from the base of being in the same way that a phantom appears from nothing but has no essential substance or reality of its own. This would be more like the casting of an illusion or mirage than the creation of a servitor.\n\u201cIn 1928 Alexandria David Neel misapplied a Tibetan term to her own thought form experiment \u2013 what we would now call a Tulpa. She was an amazing explorer and Tibetologist who made a mistake as all ground-breakers do.\nBecause so much of modern western occultism is rooted in the era of Crowley, Theosophy, and other early 20th century movements \u2013 Western Occultists naturally latched on to this term.\nUnfortunately, even though Tibetan Lamas have been coming to the west for over 50 years now, offering secret teachings, translations, and empowerment \u2013 Occultists and Magicians have mostly ignored them."

Then, the gourmet food hall arrived.\nStarting May, a revamped version of prominent French fine food brand, Fauchon, rolled out in Lotte department stores throughout the country.\nThen, in late July, food and media giant CJ Group launched its take on the slow food shopping experience with CJ Foodworld in northern Seoul.\nNext up is Dean and DeLuca.\nAccording to Hwang Kyung-sun, 31, the director for Dean and DeLuca\u2019s Korean business, last October Shinsegae signed a contract to bring in the famous American gourmet food store chain.\nThe first store is slated to open in Shinsegae Gangnam this September.\nOnce that happens, it will be interesting, indeed, to see how consumers respond.\nIf Fauchon and CJ Foodworld are any indication of local demand for well-branded, all-in-one food stops, then it looks like Seoul is all for it.\nOn a weekday morning, Sogong-dong Lotte\u2019s Fauchon is teeming with customers selecting bread, lining up to order coffee and drinks, and taking up seats on the stools in the shop.\nOn a weekday afternoon at CJ Foodworld, which spans two whole floors, shoppers populate the 19 restaurants, cafes and shops scattered throughout the area.\nCJ brand communication lab executive director Noh Hee-young, 48, attributes this trend to a movement towards increased transparency in the food-making process.\n\u201cPeople want to see how it is made,\u201d she explained.\nCJ Foodworld reflects this philosophy.\nThe first floor has a farm where soybeans and rice plants are grown. Specially-equipped rooms will hold cooking classes for both children and adults. Restaurants feature open kitchens, and groceries, cheese, charcuteries and wine are sold on the basement floor.\nIf CJ Foodworld interprets the food hall as a sort-of open community where people can purchase ingredients, cook and dine together, then Fauchon seems to view it as a cafe-bakery-retail combo.\nAt Sogong-dong Lotte, Fauchon is divided into two areas.\nA sleek black space is devoted to a beautifully-packaged line-up of jams, teas, oils, chocolates, wine and other condiments, all emblazoned with the Fauchon label. A golden space boasts an array of pastries, bread and cakes, along with a bar where coffee, juices, hot chocolate and Fauchon\u2019s teas can be ordered. Stools offer minimal seating for patrons.\n\u201cPlans are to have a larger cafe space in the Jamsil Lotte Fauchon,\u201d said Jang Seung-ho, 37, PR director for Bliss \u2015 Fauchon\u2019s Korean licensee.\nAccording to Jang, there are no immediate plans to bring in a large-scale model.\nFor now, Fauchon is a micro-food hall, combining the eating, drinking, product purchasing experience into a small-scale space.\nOn the flipside, CJ Foodworld takes the hall to mammoth proportions, recreating the European market vibe on the first floor with high ceilings and an intertwined mish-mash of sandwiches, ice cream, cakes, bread and hand-drip coffee. The basement floor is a veritable arcade of restaurants and a smattering of small shops and specialty corners.\nDo not mistake this set-up for a posh, over-the-top endeavor. According to CJ\u2019s Noh, Foodworld is not high-end, and the pricing targets the masses.\nYet there is no shaking the gourmet vibe pervading the space. Beautifully fondant-iced cakes can be reserved at least a week in advance. Coffee beans are roasted on the premises. Noodles are made fresh from dough that has been aged for 26 hours.\nThe cheese section sells everything from beurre d\u2019Isigny to high-grade Iberico ham and tubs of ricotta.\nWhile Foodworld dabbles in Western cuisine and products, there is a distinctly homegrown aura to the place, something that Noh takes pride in. Noh emphasized CJ\u2019s ability to tailor the food hall concept to Koreans.\n\u201cWe are not worried about Dean and DeLuca,\u201d said Noh, who believes that these days consumers subscribe to many brands and therefore will go to both places.\nNoh also stressed that Dean and DeLuca boasts a Western aesthetic in contrast to CJ\u2019s Korean roots.\nIndeed, Dean and DeLuca does hail from America.\nDean and DeLuca\u2019s Hwang, however, revealed that Korean palates and preferences are being taken into account, just not to the point where it would compromise the authenticity of the gourmet food retailer.\nFauchon is located in 12 Lotte department stores throughout Korea.\nCJ Foodworld is located near Dongdaemun History and Culture Park Station Line 2, 4, 5, Exit 5.

        "input": "Economists call them the \"Bric\" countries. Hiding behind the obscure title are some of the world's fastest growing and potentially largest economies - Brazil, Russia, India and China. Now the leaders of these countries are meeting in Brazil's capital Brasilia for the second Bric summit.\nThe inventor of the acronym Bric",
        "output": "is Goldman Sachs chief economist Jim O'Neill. In 2001 he argued that \"over the next 10 years, the weight of the Brics and especially China in world GDP will grow\" and as a result \"world policy making forums should be reorganised\" in favour of the Bric countries.\nSince then this economic grouping has taken on greater significance, culminating in a summit last year in Russia where the four nations talked about how they could best tackle the economic crisis.\nThe location of the first summit was poignant, because some critics say that Russia's economy is not strong enough to justify its presence in the group.\nOthers question whether the Bric states have a common agenda at all.\nBut Russian President Dimity Medvedev stresses the grouping's importance: \"In recent years Bric contribution to the growth of the world economy exceeded 50%\", adding that the four countries accounted for 14.6% of the world's economy.\nHe went on: \"By strengthening the economic base of a multi-polar world, the Bric countries are objectively helping to create conditions for the strengthening of global security.\"\nSo while the original concept was an economic one, some think that Russia is trying to turn the Bric group into a political alliance.\nRussian foreign ministry spokesman Andrei Nesterenko last week called Bric \"a reliable pillar in the formation of polycentric, fair and democratic world order\".\nAnd Arkady Dvorkovich, the Russian president's top economic adviser, said that Russia wanted these summits to become a regular event.\nThe strength of Russia's economy depends heavily on commodities like oil, and was hit hard by the global financial crisis. Last year it shrank almost 8%, unlike the other Bric countries, which continued to grow.\nSome experts described Russia as \"an outsider in Bric\" and said its economic expansion had \"been brought to a screeching halt\".\nMr O'Neill, however, defends his decision to group Russia with the other top emerging economies. He told the Financial Times that although Russia had \"disappointed\", it would \"deserve its Bric status\" if its economy bounced back soundly in 2010 and 2011.\nWhile Russia's official GDP growth forecast currently stays at 3.1% for this year, the International Monetary Fund thinks that the country's economy will grow by 3.6% in 2010, compared with China's 10%, India's 7.7% and Brazil's 4.7%.\nIf these forecasts are correct, the Russian economy could pretty much return to its pre-crisis state, beating the developed economies' growth rates despite experiencing a huge fall just a year ago.\nIt might give Moscow a chance to silence those critics who have been saying that Russia was using the Bric platform to promote and push its own agenda at the first Bric summit, while not even deserving its place in the bloc.\nThough for years Brazil, Russia, India and China have often been talked about as a group, experts note that the countries' agendas are not exactly the same.\n\"What brings them together is that they are at the frontier of capitalism,\" says Christian Lohbauer, an international relations expert at the University of Sao Paulo.\n\"But it's obvious they don't have a common agenda and their interests diverge and are [at] many times conflicting.\"\nFor example, Russia and Brazil benefit from rising commodity prices, while for China and India it is a completely different story.\nAlso, a top official at Russia's economic development ministry has said that China and India are among the 23 countries that limit free access to their markets for Russian companies.\nThis week China introduced a duty on imports of US and Russian electrical steel, accusing the two countries of selling the product at abnormally low prices.\nFor his part, Brazilian finance minister Guido Mantega said his country's manufacturers were being \"harmed\" by Beijing's currency policy, despite China being \"an important trade partner\".\nHowever such differences don't mean the bloc can be written off.\nVladimir Portyakov, deputy director of the Institute of Far Eastern Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, says the Bric countries have already managed to come up with \"some elements of the common position\".\nFirst of all, he says, they agree that emerging economies should increase their role in international financial institutions.\nMr Portyakov told the BBC Russian Service that there was an idea to use the Bric countries' national currencies in mutual trade and potentially turning them into global reserve currencies in the future.\nAt the first Bric summit, the group discussed the US dollar's status as the world's main trading currency, and the topic has made it back on the agenda.\nPresidential adviser Arkady Dvorkovich confirmed the Bric summit participants would discuss the possibility of using the International Monetary Fund's own currency - called special depository receipts (SDRs) - as a global currency instead.\n\"I do not think we may expect any detailed decision on this currency at this year's meetings, though,\" he added.\nBrazil's foreign ministry official Roberto Jaguaribe also said, \"Bric members agree that it is in their advantage to abandon the dollar in mutual transactions in the future.\n\"However, they also understand that haste in this process will result in losses.\"\nEvgeny Yasin, head of research at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, told Russian daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta that plans to discuss the possibility of abandoning the US dollar at the summit were an attempt to put pressure on the world's leading powers.\nHe points out that any dollar instability would be potentially harming to China as it could hit Chinese exports.\nMr Jaguaribe's comments seem to support this view.\n\"None of the Bric countries is interested in rocking the boat too much, everybody is interested in the dollar and depends on it,\" he said.\nAnother topic that was raised last year and will be discussed again this time is the role of developing countries in the world.\nBrazil's President Lula da Silva expects the Bric summit to call for reforms of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.\n\"We call for sweeping reforms for developing countries to have an active voice in defining their own future,\" Chinese news agency Xinhua quoted him as saying.\n\"Brazil did not become a creditor of these bodies for things to remain as before,\" he warned.\nJim O'Neill told the Times after the first Bric summit: \"Today it's embarrassing that they [the Bric countries] are not involved in an improved version of G7 and G8, and, of course, the IMF and World Bank need to have their governance structure changed dramatically to reflect this.\n\"The advent of the G20 is a step in the right direction.\"\nExperts agree that so far the Bric group has been much more about words rather than actions.\nBut if forecasts about the four countries overtaking the six largest western economies over the next two to three decades are correct, actions will undoubtedly follow.\n\"I suppose that the potential of the [Bric] cooperation should not be exaggerated and we should not expect fast results, but this potential definitely exists,\" said Mr Portyakov."

Their pregnancies are more leisurely and their pregnancy wardrobes much hotter. And their violent outbursts and reckless driving are more bizarre and disturbing for the protective layers of bodyguards and flaks and assistants and agents that come along with being a famous person.

Because fewer chips are needed, they are potentially less expensive and easier to upgrade than traditional hardware modems.\nThe effort comes at a propitious time for the cable movement: After a long and arduous process, cable modems based on industry-approved standards should be available by the end of the quarter. As a result, the long hoped-for move to sell cable modems in a retail market may finally start to develop in 1999.\nCable companies are moving to provide high-speed Internet access with lower service and equipment costs. As such, compatible products based on the DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specifications) standard are needed so that the devices can \"talk\" to equipment from a variety of vendors.\nLast week at the CableLabs Financial Analyst briefing in Denver, Colorado, representatives from Motorola, Samsung, Thomson Consumer Electronics, and other organizations were on hand to say that they expect cable modems will be certified as interoperable by March or early April, with large orders from cable companies coming soon thereafter.\nAccording to industry research, about 520,000 households now subscribe to a cable modem service. Leading cable Net access providers include @Home and RoadRunner.\n\"There have been some delays [in the certification process], but it's self-evident that things are moving quickly now,\" said an optimistic Mark Stubbe, vice president of Samsung's networking division.\nIn fact, with the availability of certified modems around the corner, some in the industry are worrying about the next step: signing on retailers. Many retailers are angling for a slice of the monthly subscriber fees the cable companies would garner in return for helping advocate cable modems. Cable operators, who are not yet making profits on the service, are balking at the idea, creating a potential roadblock for wider interest in the service.\nPatti Reali, a telecommunications analyst with the Gartner Group consultancy, said the cable operators should avoid that battle and focus on signing deals with PC manufacturers, since they are most able to offer service to those most likely to be interested. Dell Computer, in fact, has already signed a deal with @Home to pre-install cable modems in some systems.\nThe Intel-Libit effort is an effort to at least get the ball rolling.\n\"A focus for us is to get the cable world engaged in thinking about host-based modems. That's what will get the cost and the market moving,\" said Jacob Tanz, vice president of worldwide sales for Libit.\nThe companies are exploring ways to use the main processor to control networking and security functions, while the modem itself would still need chips to interpret signals from the network.\nAn Intel spokesperson declined to elaborate further, except to say that Intel \"wants to see broadband deployed\" and confirm that the company's research labs are working on reference designs for host-based cable modems, meaning the company is not signaling an interest in actually selling modems itself.\nTechnical documents describing how such a modem would work is reportedly expected to be submitted to CableLabs by March. A prototype modem is slated to be shown at an industry show in June.\nAs usual, Intel's interest in so-called \"software\" cable modems lies mainly in driving sales of its chips: With higher bandwidth connections, users would presumably download more processor-intensive multimedia content.\nThe company is involved in a number of similar efforts to migrate formerly discrete functions into the main processor. For instance, the company has demonstrated Pentium processors playing back DVD movie titles without the need for a separate MPEG-2 playback chip, and is investigating a host-based DSL modem as well."

That's a high multiple, but not entirely unreasonable considering the company's place within Canada's recently legalized adult-use program.\nRecreational marijuana sales are expected to approach 6.5 billion Canadian dollars in 2020. Aphria had supply agreements with official distributors in all 10 provinces ahead of the rollout, including an agreement to supply 175,000 kg of cannabis to Emblem Corp. over a five-year period that begins next May.\nAlthough Canadian consumers have experienced shortages during the early days of Canada's adult-use program, oversupply issues similar to those we've already seen in U.S. states could make it hard for most producers to turn a profit. Compared to its peers, Aphria appears well-poised to avoid losses after reporting an impressive CA$1.83 per gram all-in cost of production for cannabis it sold at CA$8.99 per gram during the three months ended August.\nAphria expects its licensed production space to expand from 300,000 square feet in October to over 1.1 million square feet in January. Once the company's flagship Aphria One greenhouse is able to run regular crop rotations, the company's production costs could fall again significantly.\nCanada isn't the only country where cannabis is legal. Uruguay began allowing all its adult citizens to purchase marijuana in pharmacies last summer, and neighboring countries have burgeoning medical marijuana programs.\nTo get a head start on the action heating up down south, Aphria has been expanding aggressively. Most notably, the company acquired LATAM Holdings earlier this year by issuing 15.7 million new shares. This collection of cannabis-related businesses spread throughout the Caribbean and South America could give the company a foothold in several important markets.\nAphria shares recently crashed after a short-seller accused the company of double-dealing. In a nutshell, investors betting against Aphria claim company insiders purchased dubious Latin American assets that Aphria acquired at a huge markup as part of its LATAM Holdings acquisition.\nThis isn't the first time Aphria used hard-earned money provided by investors to acquire businesses at least part-owned by company insiders, and the expenses are taking a toll. Whether recent accusations of rampant, undisclosed double-dealings are true or not, stock dilution is reason enough to be nervous about buying this stock right now. Aphria's outstanding share count has risen 77% in just two years, which means that investors who held the stock that long have seen the company's market cap soar 174%, while the price of their shares rose just 39%.\nAphria's operations actually lost CA$10 million during the three months ended this August, and staffing dozens of businesses that it now owns around the globe could expand those losses. Also, oversupply issues are almost certainly going to pinch profits in the years ahead, which means investors buying the stock now could end up facing another round of dilution.\nAphria recently appointed a special committee to review the questionable LATAM Holdings acquisition. Even if we assume the committee confirms the company's beliefs that it did nothing wrong, bargain shoppers would be much better off waiting for some good news on a fundamental level.\nNow that Aphria's market cap has fallen to just $1.1 billion, gaining a large share of the Canadian market could allow the stock to outperform over the long run -- but only if marijuana prices hold up through an oncoming supply glut and the company stops using its own shares like Monopoly money. Right now, those just don't seem like risks worth taking."

The Fairmont Vancouver Airport, which sits directly above the U.S. departures terminal, has a soundproofed spa and serves afternoon tea. Adjacent to the Denver International Airport\u2019s Jeppesen Terminal is a Westin that offers mountain views and a rooftop pool. Next year, the TWA Hotel will debut in the Eero Saarinen-designed terminal at New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport to provide retro-styled relief to tired travelers.\nBut for the most part, airport hotels feel like utilitarian sleep boxes; even the best have a you-could-be-anywhere vibe. They\u2019re great if you have a four-hour layover and just need a shower and some shuteye, but if you\u2019re staying longer, they\u2019re not the only option.\nSome savvy travelers are booking five-star retreats that are almost as convenient. They\u2019re located close enough to the airport to work for long layovers, early departures, brief business meetings, and international rendezvous, but because they\u2019re designed as destinations rather than stopgap lodging, they offer distinctive design, memorable meals, and even some serious leisure activities.\nAt the new Solis Two Porsche Drive near Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta, guests can learn to drive sports cars. The Westdrift Manhattan Beach, 10 minutes from Los Angeles International Airport, has a nine-hole golf course. Farther afield, at the Roseate House New Delhi, a five-minute drive from Indira Gandhi International Airport, you can wander in acres of gardens or take a dip in the 100-meter swimming pool.\nWhile these hotels may not be within walking distance from the luggage carousels, they don\u2019t require a trek downtown. Since many airports are located in outlying areas, an open-minded traveler can find a country property with lots of character. In the U.K. are grand estates-turned-resorts; in France, it\u2019s manors and country inns.\nIn less cosmopolitan areas, the options can be even more rewarding: Consider the Umstead Hotel and Spa, just a seven-minute drive from Raleigh-Durham International Airport, where you can get 24-hour room service instead of a bowl of bagels. At the seven properties below, all fewer than 20 minutes from a terminal, you\u2019ll be praying for a flight delay.\nDistance: A 10-minute taxi from Los Angeles International Airport (LAX)Instead of battling the city\u2019s notoriously tangled downtown traffic, head toward the beach. Though it\u2019s not directly on the ocean, the Westdrift has a laid-back, modern feel\u2014like West Elm, in a good way. Amenities include an outdoor swimming pool, a nine-hole golf course, a crossfit-inspired gym, and an indoor-outdoor restaurant. From $185 a night.\nDistance: Ten minutes from Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (DFW)True to Texas stereotype, this resort does it big. Spread over 400 acres, it has three swimming pools, two golf courses, indoor and outdoor running tracks, and a sandy beach\u2014all just minutes from the airport. If you get in late, there\u2019s 24-hour room service. And if you haven\u2019t had enough time in the air, you can sign up for an aerial yoga lesson. From $455 a night.\nDistance: A 15-minute trip from Dulles International Airport (IAD)You don\u2019t have to choose between a chain hotel or a 45-minute slog to downtown Washington. At Lansdowne, which overlooks the Potomac River, you can book a treatment in the 12,000-square-foot spa or hike one of the trails winding through the 476-acre property. Deluxe suites from $569 a night.\nDistance: Five minutes from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL)Go from the airport to the racetrack in 300 seconds flat. The year-old Solis overlooks the Porsche Experience Center at the carmaker\u2019s North America\u2019s headquarters.

Take away the massive public relations machinery that surrounds these wars and the deaths they cause are just as cruel, just as wrong. The abstract \u201cenemy\u201d dead, in every case, turn out to be human beings, who deserved to live.\nAnd every war and every mass murder spreads fear and hatred \u2014 and inspiration \u2014 in their aftermath. We can\u2019t go to war without spawning imitators. The next day, USA Today reported, the vigils at two South Carolina churches, in Charleston and Greenville, were disrupted by bomb threats and the churches had to be evacuated. So did Charleston\u2019s county building.\nUntil we begin demilitarizing our relationship with the world, such words uttered by presidents are as empty as the words Dylann Roof uttered in prayer at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church that fateful night.\nRobert Koehler is an award-winning Chicago journalist and editor."

After parliament passed the law in April, LiveJournal stopped listing the exact number of followers for bloggers with more than 2,500.\nThe deputy head of the media watchdog, Maxim Ksenzov, recently suggested that the legislation would be applied selectively, telling the news site Lenta.ru that: \"If you post kitten pics, speak in a civilized manner and publish no classified information, you may never be required [to register], even if you have a daily audience of 1 million visitors.\""

        "output": "across, even in a print interview. I was right - when I called her, and we met for coffee, I realised that her warmth and her quick wit made her a radio natural. It took another ten years before we would work together - meanwhile, I was promoted to a job where I was no longer making radio programmes, and Amanda was winning prizes for her books, appearing as a regular contributor on programmes like 'Saturday Review', and becoming a Professor. When I went back to making radio programmes as a freelance producer, she was one of the first people I called.\nI have always been fascinated by the history of domestic life. I often think of my grandmothers and great-grandmothers and their lives at home, the hard labour of it all, but also the real creative pleasure. On my study wall I have framed some of the beautiful miniature dolls' clothes my grandmother made me as a child: works of art. I'm pleased that our series includes a programme on sewing, and values the time and creativity of the many women who spent, and continue to spend, time on sewing, craftwork, decorating their homes. But the series goes much wider than that - it's as much about men as women, and the real pleasure husbands and fathers took in home. It's not fashionable to admit it, but for many men too, domestic life provides the greatest happiness.\nThe challenge of this big series was to make each afternoon programme a satisfying story in itself, but to join them together in a coherent week for the Friday night Omnibus (2100 on Friday). Each week has a theme, and over the six weeks we move from the 16th to the 20th century. The programmes are all very different: some are funny, some very dark - like the terrible diary of domestic violence from the early nineteenth century. Some have dozens of voices in them, some are just the story of one person, drawn from intimate letters and diaries. I thought of it like constructing a quilt - each piece very different, some plain, some embroidered, but sewn together, a pattern emerges.\nAs Amanda began to write the stories in the series, and we met every week for coffee to discuss the latest programme, I began to wonder about music. Were there songs which would illustrate our themes? My friend David Owen Norris, a brilliant concert pianist and Professor of Music, put me in touch with a young academic, Wiebke Thormahlen. She began to search libraries for songs about drunken husbands, burglars, housework. And it was extraordinary what she found - a protest song about women's servitude from the 18th century; a comic song about seducing a woman who never stops talking; and my favourite, 'The Housewife's Lament', in which an early nineteenth century housewife describes the unremitting toil of her life, cleaning, cooking, ironing, and imagines a never-ending tide of dirt coming towards her. When I showed this to a young man, he thought it was funny, and it does have a twist in the end; but for me it almost makes me cry (you can hear verses from it in week 1, week 2 and week 4 of the series).\nOnce Wiebke Thormahlen and David Owen Norris had gathered a pile of sheet music, we found some great singers to bring it to life - these are not songs which have been recorded before. Thomas Guthrie is a baritone and opera director - I'd seen him in Aldeburgh, singing an extraordinary 'Wintereisse' with puppets. Our other singer, Gwyneth Herbert, doesn't usually sing this kind of song at all - she's a singer-songwriter who writes her own material, and appears at venues like Ronnie Scott's. But I'd heard her interviewed on Radio 4, and started listening to her songs, and loved the way she brought such emotional power to her performances. It's a haunting voice.\nWe recorded the music in David Owen Norris's keyboard room at the University of Southampton one Saturday; it's a large space packed with a variety of instruments so we could move round the room from the harpsichord to the forte piano to the modern piano as the series moved through the centuries. David arranged the sig tune too - a take on the old song 'Dashing Away with the Smoothing Iron', played in the style of different periods. The first week starts with a simple harpsichord - by week 6, the song's moved into boogie-woogie jazz piano.\nAny big series like this depends on having the right team. We were lucky enough to be able to book engineer Jon Calver to record the music; and to attract a team of first-class actors - among them Deborah Findlay, John Sessions and Madeleine Brolly - to read for us. The home team at Loftus - Jo Coombs, David Smith and Tobin Coombs - dealt with actors' agents, read scripts, suggested changes, and improvised sound effects. Loftus is a small and highly prestigious production company, who specialise in crafted features and documentaries - and it has been a pleasure working with them.\nIt's been such a big project - we've been working on it for a year now. You can probably tell what enormous fun it's been to bring the voices of the past to life in such a substantial series. I am really looking forward to hearing what you think of it!\nA History of Private Life, a 30-part series presented by Amanda Vickery, begins on 28 September at 1545.\nThere are two lovely features about the series on the Radio 4 web site: one by Amanda Vickery about the programme's research methods and one by Wiebke Thormahlen about the music.\nThe picture is Home Sweet Home, from the Wikimedia commons: a work in the public domain.\nI'm taken aback by the claim here and in the program that \"these are not songs which have been recorded before\". I've only listened to the first program so far, but The Housewife's Lament is a well-known song which has been recorded many times, as a trivial Google search shows. I know of recordings by Peggy Seeger, Frankie Armstrong, and Anne Hill and Cindy Mangsen for starters, and I'm sure there are more.\nI don't know what other songs this claim is being made about, but I guess that Get Up And Bar The Door is another since it's on the 'Music from the Series' page. This is another very well known song with many versions, often recorded, though I don't know if this particular version has been recorded before.\n\"You`re right, I should have said, many of these songs have not been recorded. I`ve asked the online people if they can publish this correction because I would not want to undermine our excellent music researcher by making false claims.\nSome of these songs are old folk songs which people might know - later in the series, for instance, we use 'Early One Morning' and clearly people know 'Home Sweet Home', but some have not been recorded before to my knowledge: for instance I do not think there are any recordings of the song 'A Lady's Case' which we used last week. 'How hard is the fortune of all woman kind, for ever subjected, for ever confined...' this is a song from the 1730s. Or 'Belinda', which we use in week 3.\nOr the song we use this week about servants - 'Dame Durden'. What was interesting to me is that the young people who were around at the time of the making of the series did not know even the songs which I had thought were well-known - eg 'Early One Morning', or our sig tune 'Dashing Away with the Smoothing Iron'. I went to primary school in Scotland and we learnt a huge number of folk songs, both Scottish and English, but it seems these songs are not taught in most primary schools any more. That does seem a shame to me.\"\nAre there plans to publish a book from the series? Would be wonderful!\nI've really been enjoying this series. I love the details of everyday life, and it reminds me of a lovely book I read a couple of years back - \"At day's close : a history of nighttime\" by Roger Ekirch. This covered the history of customs and activities at the end of day, and again had a lot of personal social history in it.\nI heard the omnibus on friday for the first time, I really enjoyed. I know my Mum would really like this series but is not very computer savvy. Is there an option to download to cd, or perhaps an intention to release it as an audio book?\nI would just like to say how much I am enjoying A History of Private Life. I graduated from the University of Leeds in 2007 with a PhD on a handful of Yorkshire elite women and their households, and have always been deeply passionate about the interaction of people with their built environment. It seems that such a subject for historical research has been a long time in the making, but aside from my relentless chatter about some eighteenth-century household structures to my own family, it has also sparked a huge interest from my own circle of friends. It would be fantastic to see more of this type of study laid bare at houses and record offices on a regular basis, and this series should really be projected further than radio! There is some meaty material here which should be discussed and highlighted for a wider audience, since (and Amanda Vickery has stated this) history is more than \u2018battles and legislation, of bishops and kings\u2019.\nI look forward to this more than I have anything on TV or radio for some time.

I'd love to get it for my mother for Christmas.\nI love Amanda Vickery's History of Private Life.\nI am a radio devotee, and I spend much more time listening to it than I ever spend watching television.\nAs a professor, I note the careful construction of the programme by the producer: Amanda is not the only voice, and her short talk is carefully followed by a song, a poem by a reader, then back to her etc; I played one of her programmes to students in a historiography class; as children of a visual age, brought up on 'sound bites', they were amazed that listening was not necessarily 'boring', on the contrary.\nI have been listening to the History of Private Lives, and have also loved it. Being a history graduate, it returned to many of the themes I had studied, so was a great joy. I would also urge the BBC to release the programme on cd, and perhaps expand it to a series on BBC4. It would also be great if there was a book available, which I understand will not be happening.\nWondering if any bloggers can help. Monday 12th Oct 09 A History of Private Life was all about Tea.

But as Griswold reports, many places along the latitude seven hundred miles north of the equator are",
        "output": "less a middle ground than a battlefield, where global political forces and trends are pushing Muslims and Christians towards increasingly extreme versions of their faiths.\nCiting esteemed scholars, local journalists, religious leaders, and members of militant religious organizations in six countries lying astride the tenth parallel, Griswold grapples with the local and global politics of the collision of Christianity and Islam. But she also explores the many factors that continue to raise the stakes of the collision higher and higher\u2014the war on terror and American foreign policy vis-\u00e0-vis the Muslim world, climate change and resource conflicts, to name a couple of these elements.\nIt follows that in such places, religion may be the only guiding principle, the only social, moral, even legal code to abide by. Somalia, for example, has been a \u201cfailed state\u201d since 1991; this is a place where the presence of the state and accompanying service provision is virtually nonexistent. Griswold shows how the story of the rise of al-Shabaab\u2014an Islamist militia currently wreaking havoc with horrific efficacy across Somalia and now outside its borders (the group claimed responsibility for last month\u2019s bombings in Kampala, Uganda)\u2014is both local and global in nature. Proxy wars of various scopes and varieties are no doubt a trend in the countries Griswold profiles, but her in-depth examination of each context avoids generalization and oversimplification.\nPerhaps the phenomenon of seeking \u201cdirect experience of God\u201d is one way people transcend their everyday circumstances in place where life is not merely difficult, but is instead a daily struggle for survival. It would be inaccurate to generalize, but Griswold shows this to be the case in Mogadishu, and I\u2019ve seen it for myself in Sudan. I currently live south of the country\u2019s \u201cfront line,\u201d contested area, Abyei which Griswold profiles through the story a local southern Sudanese chief who knew the fate that awaited him and his people when she was interviewing him in the spring of 2008. In May of that year, chief Nyol Paduot and his people were forced to flee for their lives when northern Sudanese troops razed the nearby town of Abyei.\nThe part of Sudan I am in right now is the site of yet another proxy war, different from the one in Somalia, but with reminiscent undertones. In Somalia, the Shabaab do the bidding of the broader Al Qaeda network and are supported by this global movement. In Abyei, Sudan, the on again, off again local warring parties\u2014Arab, nomadic cattleherders and sedentary black Christians and atheists\u2014are, as Griswold writes, \u201cpawns of their respective governments,\u201d former warring parties themselves who are uneasy partners in an internationally-brokered peace agreement signed in 2005.\nWhile it would be easy to draw negative conclusions from this book about the ways in which Islam and Christianity are currently interacting around the globe, it would be impossible not to have faith about the future of the world\u2019s interlocking religions after Griswold\u2019s profiles of individuals of different faiths who are \u201cshouldering all things together,\u201d \u201cbear[ing] witness to the coexistence\u201d of religions, as believers have done for centuries.\nMaggie Fick is a freelance journalist based in Juba, the capital of southern Sudan.

With his beatification, it's worth looking back on his papal legacy to see whether Pope Benedict XVI has followed in John Paul II\u2019s footsteps or found his",
        "output": "own way.\nHabemus papam. We have a pope. The election of Pope Benedict XVI marks the conclusion of one of the most significant transitional moments in Roman Catholicism, rivaled only, perhaps, by the convocation of an ecumenical council.\nSpeculation about the identity of the new pope has given way to questions regarding his agenda for the church. The identity of the new pope suggests a papacy that will continue the overall thrust of his predecessor. Still, there are many possible new directions in which Benedict could lead our church.\nBut another important question is worth considering: Will this pope follow his predecessor in reshaping the institution of the papacy itself?\nIn 26 years Pope John Paul II transformed the institution of the papacy in many ways. It is worth considering which aspects of that re-made papacy are likely to continue with the new pope and which will not.\nThe first Polish pope in history was never reluctant to thrust himself in the midst of world events, whether it was lecturing dictators or taking unpopular stands against both Iraq wars. Will this papal activism be an enduring feature in the exercise of the papacy?\nIt was a role particularly suited to a Polish pope who had experienced the horrors of World War II and suffered directly under a communist regime, a fact that might suggest John Paul\u2019s global activism was unique to him and may not be continued by future popes. Pope Benedict XVI, for example, is a much more reserved and even shy public figure, not likely to be comfortable as a regular \u201cplayer\u201d on the world stage.\nStill, the time when popes were considered exclusively religious leaders providing only for the spiritual needs of their flock is gone. The papacy has become a powerful voice in the world with unique moral credibility. Future popes are going to be unlikely to yield that influence entirely.\nIt is possible, for example, that Pope Benedict will feel compelled in the months and years ahead to take a public role in responding to the threat of modern terrorism, particularly because of its complex link to religion. Terrorism has been for decades a tragic reality for many in the world, but the terrorist acts of Sept. 11, 2001 gave global terrorism a much higher profile. Unfortunately this new profile took place during the waning years of John Paul II\u2019s pontificate, when his declining health made it difficult for him to offer the robust response that was typical of his earlier leadership. His successor may well feel the need to speak out strongly on this issue.\nWhen Catholics think of papal authority, they are likely to think of the formal authority that Catholic doctrine and canon law grant to the bishop of Rome. They might have in mind the exercise of papal infallibility, the pope\u2019s authority to canonize saints, and other canonical prerogatives, such as the authority to appoint bishops. In the last pontificate, however, we witnessed an exercise of a different kind of papal authority.\nPerhaps more than any other in history, the pontificate of John Paul II will be etched in memory as a string of compelling media images. One of the most enduring will be the image of the pope kissing the ground upon his first visit to a country. Many will recall photos of the pope praying with his would-be assassin, or another of the pope praying at the Western Wall in Jerusalem.\nJohn Paul II also made unprecedented use of modern transportation, traveling throughout the world, publicly affirming the unique gifts of the church in each country, challenging it to further fidelity to the gospel where necessary and, where Christians suffered from injustice, bringing that injustice to world attention. He often visited with local leaders and representatives of other churches and religious traditions as well.\nThe many instances in which John Paul asked forgiveness for past wrongs done in the name of the church were also filled with symbolic import and were unique to his papacy. Luigi Accattoli, in his book When a Pope Asks Forgiveness (Alba House), listed more than 90 instances when the pope asked forgiveness for sins committed by Christians past and present.\nNone of these papal actions were exercises of formal papal authority except in the sense that the pope was acting as head of the church. They were, instead, effective exercises of a moral authority made in symbolic gesture. The effectiveness of such gestures has been magnified dramatically in this age of modern media, giving them more potential for communicating basic gospel imperatives than any carefully worded encyclical, whose readership may number in the mere thousands.\nDo these symbolic papal actions offer possibilities for the future of the papacy? Yes and no. To be sure, this kind of ministry would have been impossible a mere century ago, but its success depends not only on modern transportation and global communication technologies but also on the character of the pope. John Paul II was, after all, an actor earlier in his life, and his intuitive sense of the dramatic gesture is not something that can be formalized. There is not much evidence, for example, that Pope Benedict shares this dramatic intuition.\nAlthough future popes will certainly recognize the value of getting out of the Vatican to visit their people, it is not at all clear that they will feel compelled to keep up the dizzying travel itinerary of the last pope. Pope Benedict almost certainly will not, nor is it clear that future popes would have the ability to make effective use of such symbolic actions.\nThe pope is the universal pastor of the church and, as such, possesses ordinary, immediate, and universal jurisdiction over the whole church; in other words the pope can directly intervene in a diocese if he thinks it necessary. But how is this authority to be exercised?\nWhat is often called papal primacy has changed significantly over the centuries. In the first four centuries of Christianity the authority of the bishop of Rome functioned more as a court of final appeal. By the Middle Ages a number of factors contributed to the strengthening of papal authority, with the pope being modeled in many ways after the emperor. By the 19th century the papacy resembled an absolute monarchy.\nThe modern papacy can exercise papal primacy or governance in two basic ways. The first might be called \u201cconfirmatory\u201d papal authority, insofar as the pope \u201cconfirms\u201d his brothers\u2014the bishops\u2014in their ministry as pastors of local churches. The pope can support the ministry of the bishops through the convocation of episcopal synods, papal visitations, and ad limina visits, in which each bishop visits Rome every five years to report on the affairs of his diocese.\nThe various congregations, councils, and tribunals in the Roman curia can also support the bishops by providing church resources that assist local bishops in dealing with pressing pastoral questions. Usually this confirmatory authority does not involve any direct intervention by the pope or his curia in the affairs of local churches.\nBut papal primacy can also take the form of a more direct intervention in the affairs of local churches. This exercise of papal authority occurs when the bishop of Rome, either directly or through curial offices, intervenes in church affairs at the diocesan level or at the national or regional level (through bishops\u2019 conferences), because the local structures of leadership have been deemed incapable of addressing a pressing pastoral or doctrinal matter or out of a concern for the unity of faith and communion.\nWhat is the proper balance between these two forms of papal governance? One view would suggest that popes should normally exercise a confirmatory ministry in which they focus on supporting the bishops in their ministry. In this view more direct intervention ought to be the exception rather than the rule.\nThis often appeals to the principle in Catholic social teaching called subsidiarity, which holds that the authority with direct responsibility for a local community must have primary responsibility for decisions made regarding that community. Only when pressing issues appear insoluble at the local level or threaten the faith and unity of the universal church should one expect the intervention of higher authority.\nMany commentators on the Second Vatican Council believe the council was trying to apply this principle by affirming the authority of local bishops and granting deliberative authority to regional episcopal conferences concerning certain liturgical matters, for example.\nDuring the last pontificate, however, many leaders in the Vatican and the pope himself took a dim view of this principle. They did not believe that subsidiarity had a theological foundation and consequently there was a certain re-centralization of authority in the Vatican and away from the bishops\u2019 conferences and local churches. Many in the Vatican felt that a strong and more centralized exercise of papal authority over the local churches was necessary to keep the church united in an increasingly fragmented world.\nOne of the most important questions regarding the future of the papacy concerns which view of the exercise of papal authority is most appropriate for the church today. Will Pope Benedict and future popes follow the example of John Paul II and stress internal church unity, consolidating authority in the Roman curia? Or will they see the principle of subsidiarity as more necessary than ever? At first glance, it would seem likely that Pope Benedict would opt for a strongly centralized church authority stressing church unity. After all, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF), which for more than two decades was led by then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, was not reluctant to intervene in local church affairs.\nWe would be wise, however, not to read too much from this. Even as prefect of the CDF, Ratzinger admitted, in principle, the possibility of a certain de-centralization of church authority. He has also called for a reduction of church bureaucracy that could conceivably allow for more church initiative at the local level.\nMoreover, we must remember that it was Ratzinger who first articulated the principle, later employed by Pope John Paul II, that \u201cin regard to papal primacy, Rome must demand from the Orthodox churches nothing more than what was established and practiced during the first millennium.\u201d This was a clear overture to the Orthodox. It is a principle that held out the possibility of a much more modest exercise of papal primacy and an openness to the principle of synodality (a principle that assumes that vital church decisions are to be made within designated bodies or gatherings of bishops) so dear to the Orthodox tradition.\nPope John Paul II added ecumenical leadership to the already demanding papal job description. His many travels brought him into frequent contact with leaders of other Christian churches, and he often welcomed them at the Vatican. His repeated overtures to Eastern Orthodoxy in particular bore only limited fruit, but they reflected his conviction that the papacy must be proactive in the cause of ecumenism.\nAnd in his remarkable 1995 encyclical Ut Unum Sint John Paul offered an unprecedented invitation to other Christian leaders to enter into dialogue with him regarding how the papacy, within the limits of received doctrine, might be refashioned to become a ministry of unity for all Christian churches.\nPope John Paul II took his role as an agent for constructive interreligious dialogue equally seriously. He was the first pope to pray at the Western Wall in Jerusalem, the first to visit the chief rabbi at the synagogue in Rome, and the first to visit a Muslim mosque. He conducted interreligious prayers for peace in Assisi in 1986, 1993, and 2002. At the same time his profound respect for other religious traditions did not dampen his zeal for the church\u2019s evangelizing mission in the world.\nWill this new feature of the Petrine ministry continue? It is impossible to know for sure, but it seems unlikely that future popes would turn their backs on this new development.\nAlthough many commentators have given Pope John Paul II high marks for his many overtures to Christian leaders and those of other world religions, many also note that, particularly in Christian ecumenism, Vatican leadership showed little willingness to compromise regarding the substance of ecumenical dialogue, the Joint Statement on Justification signed with the Lutheran World Federation being the notable exception. The hard-won accomplishments of various ecumenical dialogues often were met with Vatican criticism for not having articulated doctrinal and theological consensus in accord with traditional Catholic formulations.\nIt remains to be seen whether the future ecumenical ministry of the papacy will focus on bold public gestures or whether it will also include movements toward new, genuinely ecumenical reformulations of Catholic belief.\nUnder the pontificate of Pope Benedict, there is good reason to think the church\u2019s commitment to ecumenism will not abate. Still, although he is an accomplished theologian, Pope Benedict is also a cautious one, consequently he may not be inclined to allow bold reformulations of the received Catholic faith of the kind that might be necessary to rekindle ecumenical dialogue.\nOne of the important ministries of the bishop of Rome is to preach the gospel and preserve the integrity of the Catholic faith. But the last century and a half in particular has seen the transformation of this role. Early popes only rarely weighed in on theological and doctrinal matters, but by the time of the pontificate of John Paul II the pope had become, in effect, the chief theologian of the church.\nFor example, when Catholics today consider the role of the pope as teacher, they think of popes writing papal encyclicals. Yet the papal encyclical itself is a modern development, first employed in the 18th century by Pope Benedict XIV. It was not until the late 19th century, in the pontificate of Leo XIII, that this modern development in the exercise of the pope\u2019s teaching office took fuller shape. Pope Leo began to write longer encyclicals than those of his predecessors, offering extended theological treatments on important topics.\nThis development reached its height with John Paul II. If one compares the written output of John Paul II to that of his predecessors in terms of total pages of text (rather than total number of encyclicals), no pope has written more in the genre of the encyclical than he did.\nThis raises yet another question about the future of the papacy. John Paul II possessed an extraordinary intellect and a zealous conviction about the need to preserve the integrity of the faith in the face of dangerous contemporary intellectual currents. Will future popes feel compelled to continue the tradition of offering extended theological treatises in their magisterial documents? Is this the best way to exercise the pope\u2019s teaching authority?\nSome would say yes, arguing that contemporary tendencies toward relativism and challenges to the very notion of objective truth demand a papacy capable of offering authoritative responses to these intellectual currents.\nIf Pope John Paul II was a creative if somewhat idiosyncratic philosopher, Pope Benedict XVI is a trained and accomplished theologian. He has an extensive publishing record as a scholar and curial official. Consequently there is very little reason to believe that he will not continue in the tradition of Pope John Paul II as an active teacher of the church. We can probably expect our new pope to continue the modern trend toward producing lengthy intellectual treatises on vital church topics.\nBut will this emphasis on producing a large body of papal documents become a permanent feature of the papacy of the 21st century? Many observers believe that the emergence of a healthy pluralism in contemporary theology\u2014a pluralism encouraged by Vatican II\u2014is curtailed when popes offer extended philosophical or theological treatises that give the impression that their intellectual perspective (as distinct from their doctrinal teaching) is the only one permitted.\nIt is conceivable that future conclaves may decide that the church needs not a prolific pope but a pastoral one. Such a pope might be willing to limit his teaching authority to that traditionally attributed to the successor of Peter, namely, the modest but forceful preservation of the apostolic faith. A pastoral pope such as this would not leave behind the intellectual legacy of a John Paul II but might decide to leave the work of theological exploration to the theological community.\nTo a certain extent, every pope refashions the papacy\u2014within the limits of received doctrine\u2014in his own image. Few, however, have left such a substantial mark as Pope John Paul II. His was arguably the most influential pontificate of the 20th century. But the papacy is a dynamic and changing institution in the church. We will have to wait and see how Pope Benedict XVI and his successors will choose to fashion a new papacy for the 21st century.\nThis article appeared in the June 2005 issue of U.S. Catholic magazine (Vol. 70, No. 6, pages 10-15)."

He will have four years of eligibility remaining.\nAll of UBC\u2019s varsity sports programs are currently undergoing review with the aim of trimming a number of teams in the future, and although football was one of the sports prominently mentioned as being on the chopping block in the late fall, Davis says he has received enough assurance that he is very comfortable in making his decision.\nUBC\u2019s Sports Targeting Review is soon set to announce its first wave of surviving programs, and insiders suggest that even if football is not on that initial list, that enough groundwork has taken place behind the scenes to insure its longevity.\nSo in a lot of ways, the announcement of Davis is the unofficial way of making things official, and what a way to make a statement.\nDavis who prior to his redshirt season in Tempe, AZ., rushed for 123 yards and two scores in the team\u2019s fall scrimmage, was touted as one of that program\u2019s players to watch this past season.

A week later, Prescott dipped to the bottom after a 54-7 setback to Division 3 powerhouse Goodyear Desert Edge. Friday night, the Badgers (2-1) whooshed to the top again after a 56-3 rout of winless Buckeye Youngker (0-3).\nPrescott coach Cody Collett is tired of the ups and downs. He wants his team to get off the ride.\n\"I can't emphasize enough how important consistency is for us,\" he said. \"That doesn't start on Friday nights. It grows day in and day out, rep in and rep out. We have to establish it everywhere on the team.\"\nSenior running back Skylor Clinton has been consistently outstanding. On the first play of the game, he sprinted 69 yards along the left sideline for a touchdown. In the second quarter, he made the game a blowout with scoring runs of 20 and 38 yards and an 87-yard kickoff return for a TD.\n\"Our linemen really opened the holes for all of us,\" said Clinton, who was hardly touched on all four of his touchdowns. Junior running back Justin Castro raced 55 yards for a score in the second period when the Badgers scored 28 unanswered points to take a 46-3 lead at halftime.\n\"They've [Clinton and Castro] developed into a two-headed monster for us,\" Collett said.\nClinton gained all of his 172 rushing yards in the first half on just 12 carries, some of them out of the wildcat formation when the ball is snapped directly to the running back instead of the quarterback. Castro finished with 93 yards on eight rushes.\n\"I'm an Arizona State guy,\" Collett laughed, \"so I like to call that formation something other than wildcat [University of Arizona's nickname]. It's a big part of our offense.\"\nIn three starts, Clinton has rushed for 470 yards (156.7 average per game). He is averaging 13.1 yards per carry and has scored nine touchdowns. Castro has 220 yards on the ground with an 8.7 average per rush.\nCollett had high praise for the Badgers' special teams, which produced 12 points against the Roughriders. In the opening quarter, Elijah Smith, a 6-foot 5-inch senior, blocked his second punt this season, and teammate Zane Galpin scooped it up and raced 26 yards to give the Badgers an 18-0 cushion.\n\"That was the fourth blocked punt of Elijah's career,\" Collett said. \"We work really hard on it. He ran to a spot rather than to the ball. That's what we teach. He has a real knack for blocking kicks.\"\nPrescott's defense stifled the visitors, who ended up with 0 yards net rushing and 90 yards passing. The Badgers sacked Roughrider quarterback Henry Smalls three times and picked off a pair of interceptions by Austin Mengarelli and Ivan Teskey.\nThe Badger reserves played most of the second half, adding 10 points on a 64-yard scamper by Marco DiMaria and Daniel Habecker's 26-yard field goal, his second of the game.\nThe Badgers will open their Section 4 season at home next Friday against Flagstaff, which handed Prescott a heartbreaking 2-point loss last season.\n\"They are very sound fundamentally,\" Collett said. \"I was very impressed by their schemes. It will be a big challenge for us.\"\nAnd, Collett hopes, a less topsy-turvy ride for the Badgers."

There are at least 17 corporate retirement villages in Hawke's Bay, with four more being built.\nSure, they have all the facilities you might need, and some people are perfectly happy spending their life savings for a \"right to occupy\" a unit in one, but frankly I can think of few worse fates than winding up in a corporate box with neighbours I don't know from Adam and a fee schedule that constantly drains my bank account on the pretext of obtaining \"security\" before I die.\nMany still-productive folk are opting for the lifestyle block retirement \u2013 a surge in such sales in CHB is driven by them \u2013 but on a one-family basis that choice is health-limited.\nWe need better options. One movement providing some is so-called \"intentional co-housing\", where a group looks to create their own mini-village.\nWhat that requires is for our councils to acknowledge the realities of a retired but still able population and support multiple dwellings on rural land for retirement purposes.\nThat's a district plan \"tweak\" we could all benefit from."

        "input": "Dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) still assigns dynamic addresses for IPv4 networks, but two newer protocols \u2013 SLAAC and DHCPv6 \u2013 are vying to do the job for IPv6.\nDynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is the standard way network administrators assign IP addresses in IPv4 networks, but eventually organizations will have",
        "output": "to pick between two protocols created specifically for IPv6 as the use of this newer IP protocol grows.\nDHCP, which dates back to 1993, is an automated way to assign IPv4 addresses, but when IPv6 was designed, it was provided with an auto-configuration feature dubbed SLAAC that could eventually make DHCP irrelevant. To complicate matters, a new DHCP \u2013 DHCPv6 \u2013 that performs the same function as SLAAC was independently created for IPv6.\nDeciding between SLAAC and DHCPv6 isn\u2019t something admins will have to do anytime soon, since the uptake of IPv6 has been slow, but it is on the horizon.\nDHCP is widely used within enterprise networks today to quickly, automatically and efficiently provide leased or temporary IP addresses to end users, rather than fixed or static ones. When leases expire, the IP addresses go back into a pool of assignable addresses to be leased again.\nIt also automatically configures other network information, like DNS, the domain name system that matches the website names that people type into a search box with the actual IP address of the site. It can also provide related configuration information like subnet mask and default gateway.\nEssentially, DHCP configures a network host so that it can communicate fully on the IP network.\nDHCP eliminates problems that might occur if IP addresses are assigned manually, such as configuration errors or two devices getting the same address. Without DHCP, network admins would have to manually track down unused addresses and un-assign them in order to get them back into the pool of available addresses. With DHCP, that happens automatically when the lease expires.\nNow that everyone has multiple mobile devices, DHCP has become even more necessary. Manually assigning IP addresses in an environment in which employees were constantly moving from one network to another would be impractical.\nDHCP\u2019s ability to dynamically assign IP addresses for fixed lengths of time also provides for an efficient allocation of available IP addresses. This has become particularly important as companies try to stretch their existing inventory of IPv4 addresses.\nFrom a management perspective, DHCP allows network managers to control which devices and which people can get an IP address and which can\u2019t. And it provides visibility into IP address usage in the event that an audit or report is requested.\nOf course, not all devices should be configured through DHCP. For example, you don\u2019t want network printers to be getting new IP addresses all the time, forcing end users to update their printer settings, so in that case a static address is preferable.\nThe only downside is that the requisite DHCP server constitutes a single point of failure, since if the server goes down, nobody can access the Internet.\nDHCP works with the same type of handshake model familiar to network administrators.\nA DHCP client device that wants to access the Internet sends a broadcast packet called DHCP DISCOVER to the DHCP server on the LAN segment.\nThe DHCP server receives the DISCOVER packet and responds with a DHCP OFFER packet, offering IP addressing information.\nIf the client receives the DHCP OFFER packets from multiple DHCP servers, the first OFFER packet is accepted. The client then responds by broadcasting a DHCP REQUEST packet, asking for network parameters from the DHCP server.\nThe DHCP server then approves the lease with a DHCP ACK packet, which includes the lease duration and other configuration information.\nIPv6 was intentionally designed to allow stateless IP address autoconfiguration (SLAAC). When stateless autoconfiguration is deployed, the host essentially grabs its own IP address with no need for an additional protocol like DHCP.\nWith SLAAC, the IPv6 network listens for a Router Advertisement (RA) from the host and then assigns a 64-bit prefix. The last 64 bits of the address are derived in a process in which the host device essentially self-determines its address.\nBoth use a client/server model and both use the concept of leasing IP addresses. Both use the same four-message exchange between client and server. With DHCP for IPv4 networks, the messages are DISCOVER/OFFER/REQUEST/ACKNOWLEDGE and with DHCPv6 it\u2019s SOLICIT/ADVERTISE/REQUEST/REPLY. Both protocols provide DHCP options to the end node to provide additional information.\nThe differences are that DHCPv6 uses Unique Identifiers, while DHCP uses MAC addresses to identify the client. DHCP messages are transmitted over IPv4 packets and DHCPv6 is transmitted over IPv6 packets. DHCPv6 uses Router Advertisement (RA) and IPv6 multicast messages and DHCP uses broadcast IPv4 messages on the LAN. DHCP for IPv4 can provide the default gateway IP address to the client, whereas DHCPv6 does not have this option.\nWhen the IETF came up with IPv6 in anticipation of the world running out of IPv4 addresses, it may have envisioned a smooth transition. But, as we know, adoption of IPv6 has been extremely slow.\nWorld IPv6 Day occurred back in 2011 and today only 25% of all Internet-connected networks advertise IPv6 connectivity. According to Google, 49 countries deliver more than 5% of their traffic over IPv6 and another 24 countries have IPv6 traffic exceeding 15%. According to Alexa, of the top 1,000 Websites only 28% are working with IPv6. That\u2019s up from 23% in 2017, but it means that the vast majority of organizations are still on IPv4.\nTo further complicate matters, the original SLAAC protocol didn\u2019t include automatic DNS, which meant network managers would have needed SLAAC for IP addresses on top of DHCPv6 for DNS services. Requiring both protocols made no sense and the IETF eventually rectified that situation.\nThen there are the all-too-familiar turf battles and religious wars. For example, Android refuses to support DHCPv6, and until the Windows 10 Creator Update, Microsoft didn\u2019t support SLAAC.\nSo, what\u2019s an enterprise network manager to do?\nWell, if you\u2019re running IPv4, then there is no issue; stick with DHCP. But be aware that you\u2019re going to have to move to IPv6 eventually.\nIf you\u2019re running a dual-stack environment, with both IPv4 and IPv6, then it probably makes sense to use DHCP and DHCPv6. This gives you the most consistency and control over your environment.\nIf you have moved to an all-IPv6 network and you have no restrictions on who can join the network, then SLAAC is the best option.\nAnother way of looking at it is that SLAAC is a more lightweight protocol. It allows hosts to join the network on their own, but it doesn\u2019t provide the management layer and auditing capabilities that DHCPv6 offers."

It is doing so on the strength of a growing army of certified instructors who spread the Zumba gospel to such distant outposts as Iceland, Nepal, Papua New Guinea and even Afghanistan \u2014 at the Kabul Community Center.\nZumba instructor Liz Ramirez, a U.S. Foreign Service officer with the U.S. Agency for International Development, said in an email that she teaches classes in the heavily guarded U.S. Embassy compound that was attacked in September.\n\"In an environment like this, Zumba has been my lifeline,\" Ramirez said. \"It provides me with a creative outlet \u2026 a needed balance to the challenges and demands of the workplace. The music is upbeat and the environment is supportive.\"\nAnd you don't have to be in a war zone to need a stress reliever.\nFlorida Keys attorney Dorothy Harden discovered Zumba classes a few months ago and is hooked.\n\"It feels like exercise because you are sweating, but it's so much fun you forget you're exercising,\" she said. \"You get your inner-dance on. And now I can fit into my clothes from college.\"\nMany fitness crazes have come and gone: barefoot running, hula hooping, Nordic tracks and strip aerobics, once a favorite of Carmen Electra. Staying power is tough in the ever-evolving fitness industry.\nJohn Figarelli, founder of the National Fitness Hall of Fame Museum and author of \"The History of Fitness: Fads, Gimmicks and Gadgets,\" said: \"I think the owners of Zumba did a great job of getting it going from a business standpoint.\"\nZumba Fitness does not charge gyms to carry its classes. Instead, it trains instructors and gives them the license and use of the trademark if they join the Zumba Instructor Network.\n\"We're helping the instructors to become entrepreneurs and make a living out of it,\" said company co-founder Alberto Aghion, a Florida International University alum who last year entered the school's Entrepreneurship Hall of Fame.\nIt's a sound strategy, said Figarelli, whose book covers 100 years of working out, from 1900 to 2000.\n\"Most group exercise instructors will just go with the next popular class. But if Zumba is your business, instructors will stay with that.\"\nEnsuring instructors are successful has become the company's main mission.\n\"We have three people who all they do is call up gyms all day and try to find instructors employment,\" said company co-founder Alberto Perlman.\nThe company has made Zumba instructors easy to find, with a worldwide listing that includes all of their network instructors' classes regularly updated on the company's website.\nInstructors also receive new music and choreography about every two months. The music department now creates music just for Zumba classes, with original songs that include \"Zumbalicious,\" \"Que Te Mueve\" and \"Caipirinha,\" which was a No. 1 song in Israel.\nZumba Fitness makes its money on its instructors' academy, instructors' courses, a monthly fee for instructors in the network and on all of its branded merchandise.\nThe company has built its own line of hip, colorful clothing and footwear, workout DVDs, two video games, original music and a lifestyle magazine, Z-Life.\nThe first Zumba Fitness video game came out in 2010 and was a big success, selling more than 4 million copies \u2014 and outperforming Harry Potter's new video game. \"One headline said, 'Harry Potter and magic can't vanquish Zumba,'\" Perlman said.\nInternational music stars Pitbull and Wyclef Jean have seen the value of the Zumba loyalists and their love of music. Both performed at Zumba's national convention last year in Orlando, Fla., where 7,000 instructors from around the world congregated.\nThis was not the business model when Zumba Fitness was founded in 2001 in Aventura, Fla., by the \"three Albertos\" \u2014 creator Perez and boyhood friends Perlman and Aghion, both entrepreneurs in their mid-20s and natives of Colombia.\nThe trio's original plan was simple: produce VHS workout tapes of Perez's popular South Florida classes to sell around the country on infomercials.\nThe biggest problem for Zumba these days is counterfeiting, piracy and protecting its trademark.\n\"We are spending seven figures on fighting this,\" Perlman said. \"Counterfeiting is crazy. We see illegal instructors all the time.\"\nClark writes for the Miami Herald/McClatchy."

The cell first undergoes very small changes in which it becomes slightly abnormal or atypical, as seen under a microscope. It may also begin to divide, grow more quickly,",
        "output": "and develop some abnormal characteristics (dysplasia). Then, over the years the cells and glandular structures continue to change, become more abnormal-looking, and finally cancerous.\nCancer cells are initially confined within the prostate ducts and glands (in situ cancer), but with time the cells develop the ability to invade out of the ducts and into the blood and lymphatic system (an invasive cancer).\nUnfortunately, it is not possible to detect one or a few abnormal cancer cells. At present, technology is only capable of detecting a small lump or mass of cancer cells that may have been growing slowly for several years. By the time a cancer can be detected as a lump, it contains roughly one billion cells.\nBy far the most common type of prostate cancer is that which originates within the tiny glands of the prostate itself. This type of glandular cancer is called an adenocarcinoma. Many cases are detected by a careful digital rectal examination of the gland during a routine medical examination.\nAs with all other types of cancer, an adenocarcinoma starts as a single mutant cell that grows and multiplies to involve increasing amounts of the prostate. If left untreated, the cancer cells will eventually go through the capsule of the gland and find their way into lymph nodes, bones, or other tissues. This may occur early on in the growth of this cancer, or it may take many years to occur. Sometimes, cancer cells may escape from the prostate into blood or lymph vessels even before the tumour has become large enough to penetrate outside the capsule. The behaviour or personality of any particular prostatic adenocarcinoma is locked up in the genetic code of its mutant cells.\nHow common is prostate cancer?\nProstate cancer has become the most common cancer affecting North American men, accounting for about 24% of all newly diagnosed cancers and 4141 deaths in Canada in 2015.\nThe increased incidence during the past 2 decades is due to several factors. First, men are now living longer so they are at risk of getting prostate cancer, or any other disease, over a longer period of time. Second, because physicians now have a better understanding of prostate cancer they are performing more rectal examinations and are using diagnostic tools such as PSA and transrectal ultrasound more often to detect the cancer early.\nTherefore, part of the apparent increase in prostate cancer is due to the fact that it is simply being diagnosed more often instead of going undetected. However, there are likely other, as yet undefined, reasons contributing to the increasing number of cases."

Now that same type of thermal imaging, previously left only to expensive technical equipment, has finally made its way to your mobile phone. Seek Thermal is small",
        "output": "camera you attach to your Android or iOS phone to view temperatures around you.\nThe camera displays an image that looks something like night vision, but it\u2019s detecting heat and can do so whether its day or night. There\u2019s no doubt the capability is extremely cool (pun intended), but is it necessary? At $200, it should probably have an intended task at time of purchase\u2014rather than just being a new toy.\nThe camera is a small phone accessory which, on newer iOS devices, can be positioned forwards or backwards because the Lightning connector works both ways. On Android devices, MicroUSB means it only fits one direction, and if you have one of the few specific Android phones you\u2019ll need another adaptor to make the camera face away from you.\nOut of the box, it snapped onto the bottom of my iPhone and\u2014after downloading the app\u2014I was immediately able to look at the different temperatures around my living room.\nThere\u2019s a very audible clicking noise that comes from the thermal camera. It\u2019s so prominent that I did a quick search on the company\u2019s website to see if they mention the noise. The good news is that the clicking is normal though still slightly annoying\u2014the sound is the camera continually re-calibrating itself.\nOnce you know the device isn\u2019t broken, the noise is less worrying and quickly fades from consciousness. The only issue is that your chances are slim if you had hoped on sneaking up on people in the dark.\nConsidering one of the only ways to use your phone for thermal imaging is either FLIR or Seek, the latter is definitely the least obtrusive way. I haven\u2019t tested FLIR, but Seek put up some pretty great results from a tiny device.\nAs a nice bonus, the camera also comes with a small hardshell case which is ideal for traveling. Having it protected in a small case means I would be more likely to throw it in a bag or bring it along, just in case.\nThe accompanying Seek app is a required part of the experience. There\u2019s no surprise here, most the time hardware accessories need specific first-party apps to work. Also not surprising is that like most other companies focused on a hardware product, the app\u2014or software side\u2014isn\u2019t very good.\nBottom line, the app is fine. There\u2019s nothing inherently wrong or broken with it, which is no small feat in and of itself, but it\u2019s just not anything special. For one, it\u2019s not optimized for the new iPhone 6 yet, but hopefully that will change soon. More importantly, the app just leaves a lot to be desired in terms of design.\nThe first time you open the app a navigation overlay pops up letting you know what all the buttons do. It means well, but the thermal imaging experience is so foreign that the tutorial either gets ignored or doesn\u2019t make sense until the user has played with it.\nFortunately, the app isn\u2019t very complicated. On the main screen you can either take a picture of what you\u2019re seeing or you can record a video of it. Clicking on the icon in the lower right hand corner gives a few other modes to monitor your surroundings. There\u2019s one for spot temperature, high/low differential, and threshold, where you can specify above, equal to, or below certain temperatures.\nThe spot temperature gives you a readout for the average around whatever the camera is pointed at. The high/low mode provides two temperatures on screen where it is the highest and lowest. The threshold mode allows for more control over what you can see and the ability to dial in custom monitoring.\nThroughout all modes and the entire app, the user can also choose different color palettes. None of the choices are obvious better than the others and mostly depend on personal preference and the viewing circumstance.\nViewing the different color choices, I began searching for an option that provided the most clarity, which highlighted one of the biggest possible issues with Seek. Thermal imaging can give off the impression of night vision, but it\u2019s clearly not. If there aren\u2019t items around of fairly distinct temperatures, you only see fuzzy smears of what\u2019s in front of you\u2014which can be disappointing, though not incorrect.\nAlso, keep in mind that the device does use a good amount of power from your phone so aimlessly walking around looking at heat, might not be the best use case.\nSeek gives some examples of why you might want need to see heat. One is security, being able to see a person\u2019s body heat in the dark. Another reason is for energy, to see where heat is escaping a room or house. There\u2019s also some DIY reasons like clogged pipes. These examples probably aren\u2019t regular enough uses to justify the price. There are lots of uses for thermal imaging, I just couldn\u2019t come up with many.\nIt was neat to see that my TV cabinet was giving off lots of heat, even though the TV wasn\u2019t being used. Seeing that the modem and router were warm while the Apple TV stayed cool was interesting, though again not necessary.\nThis useful superpower, like the Predator had, has its drawbacks. Which doesn\u2019t take anything away from Seek, it just means that you should have a heat related matter you plan on using Seek to assist with.\nSeek is an awesome tool. It worked as advertised\u2014though I couldn\u2019t figure out how to see the studs in the wall like is mentioned. The only concern is that the device definitely needs a specific use, even just one, for the person buying it to get their money\u2019s worth.\nChalk accessible thermal imagining up to living in the future. It\u2019s a wonderful piece of technology anyone can now own, the question still remains: Do you really need to see temperatures around you? If the answer is yes, you now have a pretty good option."

He\u2019ll also stop in Peosta today and make several stops in his home state of Illinois on Wednesday.\nThe tour is focusing on how to help the middle class and accelerate job growth, typical topics for presidential trips.

Empty homes contribute to depressed housing prices, and occupancy could help stabilize neighborhoods, federal officials said.\nAt the town hall meeting, Obama defended the compromises he\u2019s made, which some members of his own party have faulted.

Nationally, his approval is at 39 percent, the lowest since he took office, according another Gallup Survey released Sunday.\n\u201cHe knows that this is a state that he must carry if he is to win his second term,\u201d said Matt Strawn, Republican Party of Iowa chairman. \u201cSo make no mistake this visit has everything to do with politics and very little to do with policy.\u201d Congress suffers from poor poll ratings, too. A CNN poll released earlier this month showed that just 14 percent of respondents approve of the way Congress is handling its job.\nIn Iowa Monday, Obama did what he\u2019s done in recent days: Attempt to redirect voter angst from himself to Republicans in Congress. He has reminded Americans that the United States nearly defaulted on some of its $14.3 trillion of debt earlier this month because of political gridlock. Standard & Poor\u2019s cited that intense bickering as a key factor in the nation\u2019s credit rating downgrade.\nObama has a difficult argument because he\u2019s battling something called \u201ccounterfactuals,\u201d a term to describe what would have happened otherwise, said Jonathan Gruber, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and one of the designers of the president\u2019s health reform law.\nCritics bash Obama about the economy, but those arguments fail to factor what would have happened if such things as stimulus spending or bank bailouts had not occurred, Gruber said. The auto industry, which is on its way back from near disaster, is a prime example, he said.\n\u201cMany people are saying the stimulus failed because the economy is in the tank,\u201d Gruber said. \u201cWhat president Obama needs to do is say basically what all mainstream economist believe, which is the economy would have been way more in the tank had he not done stimulus.\u201d Obama appears vulnerable partly because of the nation\u2019s 9.1 percent unemployment rate. The rate was 7.8 percent when he took office in January of 2009. Other than Ronald Reagan, no president since World War II has won re-election with unemployment above 6 percent.\nFred Abraham, head of the economics department at the University of Northern Iowa, cautioned that many factors influence both the economy and re-election campaigns.\nEconomic downturns take a good decade to play out, he said. The blame or the glory for the economy isn\u2019t appropriate for any president, he said."

        "output": "trade policy that's hurting their state or district could turn off voters who would view that as criticizing Trump. But Democrats aren't exactly free traders, and they're not piling on the president's tariffs the way they attack his other policies.\nThe big picture: Politically speaking, \"If the Chinese blink and back down, it's a victory for Trump and a plus for Republicans,\" said Chris Wilson, a GOP pollster who worked on Sen. Ted Cruz's 2016 campaign. \"But the risk if we get into a prolonged trade war is there will be local and potentially national impacts.\"\nWhat they're saying: Republican Senate candidates trying to defeat Democrats in red states that Trump won aren't going to jump at the opportunity to undermine their support of the president, despite the party's traditional free-trade ideology.\nIn North Dakota \u2014 one of the GOP's best pickup opportunities this cycle \u2014 Rep. Kevin Cramer has issued carefully worded statements on Trump's tariffs, emphasizing the need to protect farmers while stopping short of criticizing the president. He also accused Democrats of stoking \"hysteria\" over the tariffs.\nSen. Heidi Heitkamp, the Democrat who holds the seat now, has said the tariffs would cause a \"devastating blow\" to the state's agriculture sector and accused Cramer of belittling his constituents.\nA similar dynamic has played out in the race for Tennessee's open Senate seat, where Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn has called the tariffs \"part of a negotiation and a process,\" while former Democratic Gov. Phil Bredesen has criticized the tariffs in a TV ad.\nThe other side: Democrats, however, aren't all universally opposed to the tariffs. Some have always been skeptical of free trade and support the tariffs, while others say they wish Trump had executed them better.\nSen. Chris Van Hollen, the caucus's campaign chair, said each member will act based on how their state is impacted. \"The bottom line here is each member\u2019s job is to defend the interests of the people in their states,\" he said.\n\"I support the president\u2019s tariffs. I wish that they would be done better,\" said Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who said he's been concerned about trade policy long before Trump became president.\nOthers are more skeptical. \u201cIt\u2019s already taking us down a road that\u2019s going to have some real negative impact, particularly on agriculture and construction,\" said Sen. John Tester of Montana. \"If I thought there was an end game here that he could actually achieve, I\u2019d be a little less concerned.\"\nIt's not just Senate races that could be affected by the tariffs. One GOP operative said that in House seats in the Midwest, where the tariffs are starting to hit soybeans and dairy farmers, \"it could be a real issue.\"\nThe operative said it could be a problem in places like Iowa's third district and Minnesota's first, which are both rated as toss-up districts by the Cook Political Report."

        "output": "bloody \u2014 moment in history, and told in the voice of a 12-year-old girl. Nisha takes us on her personal journey as part of the mass exodus of millions of Hindus and Muslims across the border between India and newly established Pakistan, a turbulent time known as Partition.\nWe learn Nisha's story through her journal, full of the letters she writes to the mother she never knew, who died giving birth to Nisha and her twin brother. \"My father went through Partition when he was nine,\" says author Veera Hiranandani. \"He had to leave his home, with his mother, his father and his five siblings. Basically, they packed what they could, got on a train and left for the new border of India.\"\nIt certainly is rare, to have happened at that time. But it did happen, and part of the reason I wanted to do that is that I am from a mixed background. My father is Hindu, and my mother was born in this country, and she's Jewish. And having multiple identities was something I've always been navigating. But I wanted Nisha to be from a mixed background, not only for my own personal connection, but it allowed me to explore her own sense of belonging during this time, and it allowed me to open up and break through some of the bias, and explore the questions I had about that time.\nHer father's a doctor, he's very busy, pretty reserved, and she doesn't have a mother. She doesn't have an incredibly intimate relationship with her grandmother either, and Kazi really functions almost as this mother and father and friend for her, because she's lonely in that way ... he knew what her mother was like, and he, bit by bit, sort of shares that with her. Also he introduces her to cooking and ignites her love of food, and that is a way for her to express herself, because she's very shy ... and that is certainly a part of me.\nI hope it resonates on a few levels. I think kids that I know, in my area, they learn about what a refugee is, but I don't know if they always have a specific sense of what that means for an individual person going through this. So I hope that readers will see that Nisha is a 12-year-old girl who loves her home, has a complicated relationship with her father, loves her brother \u2014 and also they fight \u2014 and she wonders what's for dinner, and she does all of these things that I think most 12-year-olds could relate to. And another aspect that I hope readers would take away from is that Nisha really doesn't understand how brave she is, and that takes her a long time to understand how brave it is, during a time of adversity, that she hangs on to that hope. And because she comes from this mixed background, she doesn't understand why people separate themselves in the way that they do. And that certainly is resonating today more than I even expected when I started writing this novel years ago."

        "output": "state officials, the hospital\u2019s interim president told employees during private town halls this week. None were reported until recently.\nThe hospital\u2019s former leaders also didn\u2019t properly notify the board of trustees about safety concerns in the heart surgery department. That led to the federal government\u2019s recent declaration that All Children\u2019s had left patients in danger, the interim president said.\n\u201cLeadership knew there were quality and safety issues and did not elevate it in appropriate ways to the board,\u201d said Kevin Sowers, who is president of the Johns Hopkins Health System and has also been the interim president at All Children\u2019s since December.\n\u201cSome of the people we put here did not act in the best interest of the children we were caring for or this organization,\u201d he said.\nThe disclosures came during a pair of wide-ranging and remarkably candid town hall meetings Sowers held with hospital staff earlier this week. The Tampa Bay Times obtained and reviewed video of the meetings, which also illustrated the emotional strain the turmoil in the Heart Institute has placed on longtime staff members.\nSowers described a series of lapses by the hospital\u2019s former leaders \u2014 \u201cpeople that we trusted,\u201d he said \u2014 that hid the Heart Institute\u2019s problems from the internal and external oversight designed to keep patients safe.\nThat secrecy was shattered in November, when a Times investigation revealed that the unit\u2019s mortality rate had tripled in just two years to become the highest in Florida.\nMedical staffers began bringing concerns about two of the program\u2019s surgeons to their supervisors in late 2015, the investigation found. But hospital administrators did not slow surgeries or make personnel changes until 2017.\nThe reporting led to the resignation of CEO Dr. Jonathan Ellen, two heart surgeons and the three vice presidents in charge of risk management, patient safety and communications.\nIt also led to inspections by state and federal regulators, who visited the hospital last month and placed it in a rare status called \u201cimmediate jeopardy.\u201d Hospitals in that status lose public funding if they don\u2019t fix the problems within weeks.\nThe reports from those inspections have not yet been made public. But Sowers said regulators made the immediate jeopardy determination because of the lapses in oversight, not because patients were in danger at the time of the mid-January inspection.\nHe said the hospital\u2019s prior leadership team was aware of the Heart Institute\u2019s problems. But when it filed a required quality improvement plan with the board, \u201cthere was absolutely nothing in the plan about the heart center,\u201d he said.\nSowers described Ellen as wielding tremendous control over both the hospital and information about patient safety problems. Ellen held the roles of president, vice dean, physician in chief and director of graduate medical education. He had the power to set and approve the agendas for the board\u2019s patient safety committee, Sowers said.\n\u201cStructurally, one person should never have that much power at the top of an organization,\u201d Sowers said.\nEllen, a longtime Johns Hopkins faculty member who was sent to St. Petersburg to integrate All Children\u2019s into the Johns Hopkins system, could not be reached for comment Friday. In April 2018, during an initial interview about the Heart Institute, Ellen told the Times his leadership team had been transparent. \u201cIf we found something that went wrong, we would notify our board, we would notify the right regulatory agencies, we would look at our processes,\u201d he said.\nSowers said the hospital\u2019s leadership structure is being changed to spread those responsibilities across more people and to better connect the hospital\u2019s safety officials with administrators in Baltimore.\nAll Children\u2019s is governed by multiple boards. The hospital is owned by a branch of Johns Hopkins Medicine, which has a board of trustees in Baltimore. But All Children\u2019s also has a local board of trustees, made up of prominent community leaders. Few have medical backgrounds.\nIt was the local board, hoping to raise the hospital\u2019s profile, that decided to effectively give All Children\u2019s to Johns Hopkins in 2011. Ellen was placed into power at the hospital shortly after. And the hospital revised its Articles of Incorporation to give Johns Hopkins near-complete authority to approve or overrule the local board\u2019s decisions.\nThe local board now \u201creally wants to understand what happened, and why they didn\u2019t have the information\u201d about the institute\u2019s struggles, Sowers said.\n\u201cJust as you all mentioned that you are angry, some of them are angry, too, and they should be,\u201d he said.\nSowers apologized to them, he said.\nAt Johns Hopkins Medicine, \u201cthey are just as upset, because they are trying to figure out how did people that we trusted not raise up the appropriate issues not only to the All Children\u2019s board but not even to Baltimore,\u201d he added.\nFormer Progress Energy Florida CEO Vincent Dolan, who served on the local board until his term expired in 2018, described the situation differently than Sowers. In an email to a Times reporter, Dolan praised Ellen as \u201ca person of great integrity\u201d who prioritized safety. Dolan also said he was aware of the problems with the Heart Institute and had participated in \u201cdetailed discussions\u201d about the topic on the safety committee and in board meetings.\n\u201cWe were briefed about the Heart Institute issues \u2014 some of us in more detail than others. \u2026 I feel the Board was reasonably well informed,\u201d Dolan said.\nThe federal government gave the hospital until Sunday to propose a plan for how it will address the issues. Sowers told the staff he was confident All Children\u2019s would file a successful plan on time and its public funding would not be affected.\nIn addition to discussing the governance issues, Sowers told employees the hospital had been cited by the state for not properly reporting the 13 cases in which patients had been harmed by medical care.\nUnder Florida law, the hospital should have reported those incidents within 15 days of them occurring.\nHospital leaders found the incidents by reviewing all of the Heart Institute\u2019s cases from 2015 to 2018, spokeswoman Kim Hoppe later told the Times. Six were deaths, five of which were reported in the Times investigation, she said.\nIn the town hall meeting, Sowers said the hospital was reaching out to the families of all 13 children, as well as the other families profiled in the Times investigation, to apologize and provide support moving forward.\nSowers said the hospital had reviewed every death outside of the Heart Institute, as well. But it found nothing outside of the unit that needed to be reported, he said.\nThis wasn\u2019t the first sign that All Children\u2019s had failed to report serious problems.\nLast year, the Times reported on two cases in which All Children\u2019s surgeons had left needles in patients \u2014 a situation hospital officials are legally required to disclose.\nIn May, the state Agency for Health Care Administration cited the hospital for failing to properly report both incidents.\nNonetheless, in June the agency reported that All Children\u2019s had corrected the issue and did not fine the hospital.\nBoth town hall meetings also included lengthy question-and-answer sessions during which staff members voiced concern about how the crisis had affected the community\u2019s trust in the hospital.\nSowers was particularly troubled to hear cases of employees facing retaliation for speaking up, he said.\nAt times, the question-and-answer period gave way to emotional testimonies from long-time employees.\n\u201cFor someone who has been here for 30 years, I\u2019m pretty angry (at) our leadership and what they\u2019ve done and sad for the people who are still here, doing the hard work,\u201d one said.\nSowers said she had \u201cevery right\u201d to feel that way.\nSowers asked if the employee was upset with him or the previous administration.\nSowers said what mattered to him was acting in the best interest of children, not Johns Hopkins. He said Johns Hopkins had let All Children\u2019s down.\n\u201cI just wanted to hear you say that,\u201d the employee said.\nHad an experience with All Children's Hospital?\nWe'd like to hear from you.

Andrew Cuomo and legislative leaders in Albany have come to an agreement that will eventually raise the state's minimum wage to $15 for everyone.\nThe measure is included in the state's 2016-2017 budget package, which legislators passed Friday.\n\"We believe that people who work hard should be able to earn a",
        "output": "decent living and support a family with dignity,\" Cuomo said.\nCuomo first proposed a statewide $15 minimum wage back in January. It represents a 67% increase over the state's current $9 minimum. Cuomo estimated it could directly benefit 2.3 million workers, who represent close to a quarter of the state's workforce.\nBut it may also have the effect of pushing up pay for workers who make more than minimum wage, since employers will need to preserve pay differentials between entry-level jobs and more senior positions.\nThe hike to $15 would be phased in more slowly than the governor originally proposed -- and in some parts of the state, much more slowly.\nFor most New York City businesses, the minimum wage will rise to $11 at the end of 2016, then increase by $2 each year until it hits $15 by the end of 2018. But businesses with 10 or fewer employees will get an extra year. Their minimum wage will rise to $10.50 at the end of this year, then go up by $1.50 each year until it reaches $15 at the end of 2019.\nIn areas near New York City (i.e., Westchester, Nassau and Suffolk counties), the minimum wage won't reach $15 until the end of 2021.\nAnd for businesses in upstate New York -- where towns and cities have had a harder time economically -- the minimum wage would only climb 70 cents a year until it reaches $12.50 by 2020. After that, the upstate minimum will continue increasing to $15 but at a pace set by the state's budget director in consultation with the state's labor department.\nIn addition, starting in 2019, the budget division and labor department will annually assess the economy in each region and the effect of the minimum wage hikes to figure out if it's necessary to temporarily suspend the scheduled increases.\nThe New York deal comes just hours after California became the first state in the nation to pass a statewide $15 minimum wage.\nThose who support an increase highlight how a $15 minimum wage could help the overall economy. By increasing wages for those who need it most, they will be less likely to quit, reducing turnover costs for employers. And the low-wage workers -- along with their colleagues who also may get a pay bump -- will spend the extra money in their local economy, which in turn can boost demand and help create other jobs.\nBut those who oppose the hike worry it will hurt businesses and jobs in struggling economies in upstate New York. Less concern is expressed for the economies of downstate New York -- primarily New York City, where the cost of living is high and job growth has been strong.\n\"I speak to a lot of people in my industry and we're all very, very nervous about it,\" Nielsen told CNNMoney before the deal was announced.\nNew York state already requires large food franchises to move toward paying its fast-food workers at least $15 per hour. And Governor Cuomo recently mandated the same for state university workers."

She used her first purchase order as the basis to obtain financing.\nIt was a smart bet that raised her visibility and led to orders from the campus retailer Follett and an ecommerce site called The Grommet, which sells innovative products from local small businesses.

Her story of building a one-woman innovation and manufacturing business and making it onto HSN offers interesting insights for other entrepreneurs who've dreamed up new inventions. Here are some takeaways from her story.\nRaquel Graham has built a presence on HSN with inventions such as a less-bulky scarf alternative and a ski cap with a built-in LED light to illuminate dark running paths.\nStay open to unexpected opportunities. Graham, 49, didn\u2019t start out planning to be an inventor.

To reinvent her career, she enrolled at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University to earn her MBA.\nLife had its own plans for her, and in the first month of school, Graham discovered she was pregnant. When her second child was born prematurely, she realized she didn\u2019t want to work in a corporate career anymore. \u201cI wanted to create something or find something where I could spend more time with my family,\u201d she recalls. Instead of job hunting after she received her MBA, she started Roq Marketing Group, a consultancy, in 2009, offering strategic marketing advice to corporate clients. \u201cA lot of them were Ebony clients,\u201d she says.\nAs her children grew, Graham found herself facing a challenge that frustrates many moms: making sure they bundled up in the cold. When she came up with her NEKZ wraps as a solution, she didn\u2019t let the fact that she\u2019d never invented a product or manufactured one stop her. She created her own prototype and then got professional advice on how to perfect it.\nThe DIY approach works for many inventors, says John Khalil, founder of Patent Lot, a site that connects inventors and attorneys, and inventor of Scent2o, a natural product that uses the power of scent to makes plain water take on flavors such as root beer or lemonade, who will also speak on the panel.\nAlso important, Khalil says, is to do your homework with the U.S. Patent and Trademark office to make sure you\u2019re inventing something that\u2019s truly new. \u201cIt pays to know what\u2019s out there,\u201d he says.\nStep into the limelight. Graham had no TV background, and could easily have talked herself out of appearing on HSN. Instead, she embraced the challenge, tapping her background doing corporate presentations to perfect her pitch and rehearsing again and again before she did her demo tape.\nStill, she knew there would be a learning curve and threw herself into mastering the skills she needed to succeed. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy,\u201d she acknowledges. \u201cYou have a producer [speaking on a microphone] in your ear. You have to learn to work with the host and follow your cues. You\u2019re also reading [from a screen] to see how well your product is doing on air. There\u2019s no script, so you go with the flow.\u201d Fortunately, she discovered, she was good at winging it.\nKeep expanding your repertoire. Graham could have stopped with one product, but she decided to see how far she could take her idea of building a company around \u201csolutions to make life easier.\u201d When, as an early-evening jogger, she found herself searching for a way to illuminate the paths in front of her, she came up with the idea for Headlightz. The beanies, which have a rechargeable LED light, debuted on HSN in November 2017, selling out during Black Friday and Cyber Monday.\nGraham had some big health challenges along the way. Two years ago, after an early misdiagnosis, she was found to have pneumonia blastomycosis, a fungal type of pneumonia that became life-threatening. By the time doctors realized what was wrong, she had suffered lung and heart failure and had a stroke. At one point, she was put on a ventilator. She had to learn to walk again, in a recovery process that took a year. Last November, she finally finished her rehabilitation."

        "input": "THE Murray-Darling Basin is one of Australia\u2019s richest agricultural regions. The same area as France and Spain combined, it produces A&dollar;10 billion (\u00a34.7 billion) worth of produce a year, including fruit, vegetables, cotton and mutton. But the life of the area, which springs from the 19 rivers that flow into",
        "output": "it, is under threat.\nEarlier this month, four state governments and the national government banned farmers from taking more water than they do now. Their decision followed the release of a \u201cwater audit\u201d of the area, which found that only 25 per cent of what flows into the basin ever reaches the sea. And demand for water is increasing. Without the moratorium, farmers would have taken another 14 per cent of the in-flow over the next 20 years (see Diagram). This could have been disastrous. Fish are already dying in the rivers, salinity is increasing, and blooms of toxic cyanobacteria are likely, says the report.\nTo the north and west of the basin are the rangelands \u2013 home to about 10 000 families, 19 million sheep and 6 million cattle. This area makes up some 60 per cent of Australia, and much of it is marginal land. The huge numbers of farm animals and wild horses, camels, goats and rabbits take a heavy toll. As vegetation is eaten or trampled, the thin soils are left exposed to wind and rain with devastating results. A study published in April recommends that farming should stop over vast tracts of this land before irreversible damage is done.\nThe water audit and the rangelands study are two of a string of recent reports that reveal how agriculture is killing the land and the native fauna and flora in many parts of Australia. They have raised the national debate over the future of agriculture and the best way to manage the land. While most Australians agree that action is needed to stop the destruction, the unanswered questions are what exactly should be done and who should foot the bill.\nAgriculture is one of the mainstays of Australia\u2019s economy. But ironically, the country is not well suited to the European styles of farming that are practised. \u201cThat Australia\u2019s agriculture has been as productive as it has is a testament to Australians\u2019 innovation, technical skill and determination over two centuries,\u201d say government scientists in a paper prepared for a meeting of the Prime Minister\u2019s Science Council last month. The country\u2019s soils are thin \u2013 most are less than 10 centimetres deep \u2013 and contain little organic matter. The weather is not dependable either, often fluctuating between prolonged drought and severe flooding. Added to this, Australia\u2019s native mammals have padded feet that do minimal damage to soil. By comparison, the hooves of imported animals are far more destructive.\nLast month, the Australian government\u2019s Biodiversity Unit released two reports that delivered some harsh lessons about the clearing of bush and woodland for farming. The first reveals that in the decade to 1993 Australia cleared an average of 500 000 hectares per year \u2013 the equivalent of two rugby pitches a minute. This is one of the worst records in the world. In 1990 Australia stripped 650 000 hectares, more than half the area cleared in the Amazon Basin.\nThe report also scotches a common belief that most of the clearing took place in the last century. In fact, as much land has been cleared in the past 50 years as in the preceding 150 years. And the clearing continues. Last year, permits were granted to clear more than 1 million hectares of Queensland, including 685 000 hectares of virgin bush.\nThe second report is an analysis of satellite images. It concludes that vegetation over nearly half the country has been \u201csignificantly or substantially disturbed\u201d.\nLand clearance has been costly in terms of environmental damage. Disruption of the water cycle in cleared areas has reduced the rainfall by as much as 14 per cent. Biodiversity has also suffered. A small carnivorous marsupial called the numbat, for example, used to be widespread. It is now confined to a few pockets of surviving vegetation in Western Australia. Similarly, only 30 000 hectares of the native bush brigalow, Acacia harpophylla, are left. It used to cover 6 million hectares. Hal Cogger from the Australian Museum in Sydney estimates that clearing scrub to make room for wheat, kills more than 85 per cent of the resident reptiles, such as goannas, skinks and pythons. This amounts to killing about 200 animals per hectare.\nAustralia\u2019s National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Committee estimates that burning wood from cleared forests accounts for about 30 per cent of Australia\u2019s emissions of carbon dioxide, or 156 million tonnes a year. And water tables are rising beneath cleared land. In the Western Australian wheat belt, estimates suggest that water is rising by up to 1 metre a year. The land is becoming waterlogged and unproductive or is being poisoned by salt, which is brought to the surface. The Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) reckons that 33 million hectares has been degraded by salination. The federal government estimates the loss in production from salinity at A&dollar;200 million a year.\nAccording to Jason Alexandra of the ACF, this list of woes is evidence that Australia is depleting its resources by trading agricultural commodities for manufactured imports. In effect, it sells topsoil for technologies that will be worn out or redundant in a few years. The country needs to get away from the \u201ccolonial mentality\u201d of exploiting resources and adopt agricultural practices suited to Australian conditions, he says.\nRobert Hadler of the National Farmers\u2019 Federation (NFF) does not deny that there is a problem, but says that it is \u201cillogical\u201d to blame farmers. Until the early 1980s, farmers were given tax incentives to clear land because that was what people wanted. If farmers are given tax breaks to manage the land sustainably, they will do so. Hadler argues that the two reports on land clearance do not say anything which was not known before.\nGraetz, who analysed the satellite photographs for the second land clearance report, argues that there is now better cooperation between Australian scientists, government officials and farmers than in the past. One example is the Murray-Darling Basin Commission, which Graetz says has forced four states \u2013 Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia and Queensland \u2013 and the Australian Capital Territory to talk with one another. \u201cThey were forced to do the water audit and find out who is pumping the Darling and why it is not flowing as it should,\u201d he says.\nThe problems of the rangelands are also being studied by a group of scientists, farmers, government officials and Aboriginal groups in an effort to draw up a national management strategy. One likely outcome is that sheep and cattle will be removed from some areas. In a report published in April, ecologists from the CSIRO recommend that a stewardship system should be set up. Instead of tending livestock, farmers who find it hard to make a living should be paid to conserve the land and protect it from feral animals, fire and other threats to the environment. Extra income could be generated by farming native animals such as emu and kangaroo.\nThe NFF advises farmers to treat native trees as potential crops. While they are growing, species such as the eucalypts help to reduce land degradation, and after felling the timber can be sold as hardwood. Farmers have also taken to growing native plants such as acacias, grevilleas and banksias around fields of grain crops. These \u201calley crops\u201d act as windbreaks, prevent erosion, and retain moisture in the fields.\nBut the bugbear of all these conservation efforts is money. Landcare\u2019s budget is A&dollar;110 million a year, of which only A&dollar;6 million goes to farmers. Neil Clark, an agricultural consultant from Bendigo in Victoria, says that farmers are not getting enough. \u201cFarmers may want to make more efficient use of water and nutrients and embrace more sustainable practices, but it all costs money and they just don\u2019t have the spare funds,\u201d he says."

        "output": "an inventor, Thompkins, 79, started collecting models of Hess trucks. After accumulating a large number of trucks, Thompkins thought about ways to display them and keep them clean. In 2002, he tinkered with a few different designs, but an employee at the patent office suggested that he keep it simple. With that small but valuable advice, Thompkins developed his final design.\nEach display case holds a single large Hess truck or eight miniature trucks. The display cases are made of wood and lexan. They are very light in weight and can be stacked. They also have little clips that allow them to be hooked together in either an angled or square pattern so that a large number of trucks can be attractively displayed in a small amount of space. When unattached, an individual display case can be placed on a shelf to highlight a single model.\nAccording to Thompkins, the local Hess station sells 7,000 model trucks every year. People love the trucks and even buy them by the case. The trucks come out twice a year. Large models reach the shelves in November and small trucks arrive in mid-year.\nThat's a huge potential market and Hess doesn't sell display cases. The next step is to actually manufacture the display cases. When materials are bought in bulk, the cases are very inexpensive to make.\n\"I'm hoping to get someone interested in manufacturing them,\" explained Thompkins. \"I would like to see something started so I could pay off my (patent) investors and make a lot of people happy. There's a real need for it. Lots of people say them want them.\" Thompkins went to a grant writing class, but he doesn't feel his writing skills are good enough to get a business startup grant. He lives in Saw Creek Estates and is hoping he can find someone who will go into business with him.\nUnable to work since quadruple bypass surgery in 2003, Thompkins spends his time making display cases. He also makes clocks, tables, bookends, and other items from wood and epoxy plastic. His home is full of his varied interests and projects, but right now he's ecstatic about getting his patent and planning for the future.\n\"I was shocked when I got the patent,\" said Thompkins. \"I'm quite overwhelmed.\"\nOnce he gets the right business partners, he's confident his invention will succeed."

        "input": "April 15 may seem like a long way off, but with a little planning before the end of the year, you could take advantage of tax breaks to help you lower your tax bill.\nSeveral tax provisions are scheduled to expire at the end of this year.\nMany of these tax breaks",
        "output": "have been extended in the past, so it's possible Congress could extend them again over the next few months.\n\"It could be in very late December, at which point it's too late to do much tax planning, or January when you really can't do anything,\" cautions Richard Baum, a partner at accounting firm Anchin, Block & Anchin LLP.\nThe government shutdown could also delay the start of tax-filing season a few weeks as well.\nHere's a look at eight tax breaks to consider now before they disappear.\n1. Teachers' classroom expense deduction. Eligible educators who work in a school providing primary or secondary instruction can deduct up to $250 worth of unreimbursed classroom expenses. This is an above-the-line deduction, which means teachers can take this deduction before they get to adjusted gross income and regardless of whether they itemize other deductions or take the standard deduction, according to David McKelvey, a tax and business consulting partner at Friedman LLP.\n2. Exclusion of cancellation of indebtedness on principal residence. The U.S. tax code treats forgiven debts as taxable income. However, if your principle residence is foreclosed or sold in a short sale before the end of the year, this provision allows you to exclude up to $2 million of forgiven debt from your taxable income. \"I'm hopeful that [this provision] gets extended because there's still a lot of foreclosures in the pipeline,\" says Keith Spritz, managing director of accounting firm CBIZ MHM LLC. \"If you're in that position, at least it provides an easy benefit for you to take advantage of.\" If your home is on the verge of a foreclosure or short sale, you may want to nudge along the process before the end of the year to ensure you're eligible for this tax break.\n3. Transit benefits. In 2013, employees can spend up to $245 pretax per month on transit benefits such as rail passes, which is on par with the $245 pretax they can spend on parking. That parity is scheduled to sunset at the end of this year so that the benefit for public transportation would drop to $130 per month pretax, while higher parking benefits will remain.\n4. Mortgage insurance premiums. Homeowners who have less than 20 percent equity typically pay for private mortgage insurance (also known as PMI). Those premiums were deductible in 2012 and 2013, but that provision is scheduled to expire at the end of the year. \"That's an item that hurts less wealthy homeowners,\" McKelvey says. However, homeowners who itemize their deductions can still deduct mortgage interest.\n5. IRA distributions to charity. People older than age 70\u00bd are required to take minimum distributions from their individual retirement accounts, so this provision allows them to contribute that money to charity without counting those distributions as income. The provision can keep income low enough for an individual to qualify for other tax breaks that may have phase-out limits.\n6. State and local sales tax. If you pay state or local income tax, you can deduct that amount from your federal taxes if you itemize. But if you live in a state like Florida or Texas that doesn't have income tax, you can't take advantage of that deduction. This provision allows you to deduct state sales tax if your state doesn't have sales tax or if the amount you paid in sales tax was higher than income tax. \"You can use the IRS estimate based on your income and the state you live in to calculate what would be a normal sales tax deduction, and then you can add to that certain big-ticket items like a boat,\" says Mark Luscombe, principal analyst for the tax and accounting group at CCH. \"In a given year, even if you have an income tax, you might want to check both if you've made some major purchases.\"\n7. Electric vehicles. Consumers who buy a qualified electric plug-in vehicle may be eligible for a tax credit of up to $7,500 depending on the size of the car's battery pack. For instance, owners of the Chevy Volt and Nissan Leaf may be eligible for a $7,500 credit, while owners of the Ford Fusion Energi and C-MAX Energi are eligible for a $3,750 credit. Some lessees may be eligible for this credit as well.\n8. Remodeling your home for energy efficiency. Homeowners who remodel for energy-efficiency can take a credit of up to $500 over their lifetime. This provision has existed since 2006, so many taxpayers have already used the credit. \"It looks at your prior credits that you've taken so there is a little bit of a look back, and you may not get the full amount,\" Spritz says. There is a separate $500 credit available for energy-efficient appliances. If you haven't used the credit yet, there are still two months left to install new windows or buy an energy-efficient air conditioner.\nCorrected on 11/05/2013: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated a tax credit would be available for energy-efficient washing machines."

I\u2019d been mulling the idea of a conference for women bloggers, but I wasn\u2019t sure it would fly. I decided to go for it in February 2005 when I met Elisa Camahort Page and Jory Des Jardins.

We added economic empowerment to that mission after our first conference, where users told us they also wanted a better business model. That\u2019s our goal \u2013 greater visibility and autonomy for individual women bloggers \u2014 and, ultimately, for the community of bloggers as a whole.

People like Dan Gillmor, Dave Winer, Jay Rosen and David Hornik have always been incredibly collegial with advice, recommendations or just paying serious professional attention to what BlogHer\u2019s trying to accomplish.\nSo I feel really fortunate \u2014 because at the same time, women in tech deal with the ongoing factor that women are just not invited to speak or attend conferences other than BlogHer in the same numbers and there\u2019s what I\u2019ll call the \u201cround-up\u201d target=\u201d_blank\u201d>pr0n factor\u201c, the most recent example being the Golden Gate Ruby on Rails conference. Plus the fact that mainstream media has relegated women who blog to \u201cmommy bloggers\u201d or \u201cother\u201d, which is frustrating. My advice to myself and to other women whom this all drives crazy? Hey, we all know and work with people (including men!) who don\u2019t play that way and never would. So focus on your product, build something extraordinary and successful that can be measured in metrics and/or revenues. It\u2019s possible to earn the respect you\u2019re looking for. Go for it!\nLisa\u2019s Advice To Women Who Want To Launch Their Own Startups?\n1. Ask your users, potential or existing, what they want. Don\u2019t tell them. Look where that got the print newsrooms I used to work in.\n2. Bootstrap for as long as you can before you consider outside funding. It gives you enormous insight and forward inertia, which will help you find the right people to invest who are enthusiastic about your actual business and real-live users. I will be talking about all of this in more detail during my session at Women Who Tech TeleSummit coming up on May 12th."

        "output": "weeklong science mission that begins Friday.\nEach soft drink will be in its company's can designed especially for dispensing during weightlessness. The Pepsi can must still pass final tests at Johnson Space Center in Houston but NASA spokesman Brian Welch said no problems are likely.\nThe shuttle pantry will be supplied with four cans of each soft drink in what is intended as a test of the can technology and a way of giving astronauts more thirst-quenching choices. They now are limited to powdered drinks.\nCarbonated beverages have not been carried on the shuttle because no special containers were available to control and dispense the bubbly liquids in zero gravity.\nStill, one problem remains. The shuttle has no refrigerator. Never has, never will, as they say in ads for that other soft drink.\n\"There's really not been a demonstrated need for it,\" Welch said. Cold and hot water is available, he said.\nCoke \"was not meant to be consumed warm,\" said company spokesman Mark Preisinger in Atlanta. However, the cans will be wrapped in insulation to keep down the temperature.\nPepsi tastes better cold, but is refreshing no matter how you drink it, said company spokeswoman Rebecca Madeira in New York.\nFor its part, NASA is more worried about technology than taste, preferring research over refreshment.\nIf either or both soft drink cans work well, NASA has retained the legal right to use them in the future, filled with whatever drink the agency chooses.\nThe flight is a test and \"it's not like a matter of astronauts going up there to recline and enjoy the beverage,\" Welch said.\nThe Coca-Cola Co. likes to think of the flight in terms of prestige.\n\"We have had a history of being an innovator in the soft drink industry,\" and putting Coke in space is another example of that, said Preisinger.\nThere won't be a big demand for Coke on shuttle flights, but the company is interested in serving the potential market aboard a space station or other space ventures, he said.\nThe Coke can, which the company said cost $250,000 to develop, looks like a regular 12-ounce can with a special top that includes a drinking spout and valve switch. It dispenses the liquid using a lever that works like a plunger. Pepsi's can is \"quite different,\" but also uses a standard size can with a dispensing valve on top, Madeira said. A pouch inside contains individual pouches of citric acid and sodium bicarbonate.\nThe acid and sodium mix when the dispensing valve is pressed. That causes the larger pouch to expand with carbon dioxide and fill the void as the liquid is consumed, she said.\nPepsi has been talking to NASA about a space can for at least two years, she said. The technology cost $14 million to develop, but it has other applications for the company.\nLike Coke, Pepsi wants to get into space \"to be competitive,\" Madeira said.\nFor NASA, the soft drink issue first bubbled over in May.\nOn May 8, Coca-Cola distributed pictures and an announcement that it had developed a space can to be tested on the shuttle as early as July. NASA said then that there had been no final agreement.\nAgency sources said the soft drink company had hoped to put the can on a mission in April to coincide with the announcement of the change in Coke's recipe.\nNeil Hosenball, NASA's general counsel in Washington, said he was angered when the company went public with the shuttle experiment before reaching a final agreement with NASA. He said he \"fired off a letter\" to Coca-Cola.\nThe space agency, which is prohibited from endorsing products, did not want to show a preference for any soft drink.\nIn late June, NASA announced an agreement with Coke to use the soft drink and its can in July. Five days later, NASA announced that Pepsi had signed up for the same mission.\n\"It's not impossible,\" said Welch, that NASA could dispense Coke from Pepsi's can or vice versa.\nMeanwhile, NASA says other soft drink companies \"are welcome\" to devise different containers for shuttle testing."

Or it may just be that the Times has been so bad on these issues for so long that at this point, no one other than perhaps me and my readers even expects the paper not to spread anti-Jewish myths. Perhaps, at this point, the Times has lost so much credibility that no one takes the paper at all seriously when it does spread such anti-Jewish myths. Either way, the Omar episode is an excellent opportunity for the pro-Israel community to consider revisiting its approach to the way the Times covers these issues."

Most state-run exchanges are subject to laws that guarantee this notice, and the federal government imposes these same rules on the private sector, yet they have gone out of their way to avoid imposing this basic diligence on their own Obamacare exchange,\" Black said.\nThe Obama administration and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius have publicly boasted about the improvements in the efficiency of Healthcare.gov, but the progress report issued at the beginning of December by the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) contained no references to fixes to the widely reported security gaps on the website.\n\"There is an astonishing lack of required accountability for the federal government, regardless of whether the breaches are accidental, as most seem to have been, or intentional. This was an issue that was raised when HHS was putting together rules for the exchange, but they decided they were not going to do that,\" Eric Boehm of Watchdog.org tells Newsmax.\nAs Boehm noted in a recent article, there was a proposal offered to strengthen security measures prior to approval of the final rules for the exchanges were approved on March 27.\nIn that meeting, two individuals suggested taking steps to \"ensure the exchanges would promptly notify affected enrollees in the event of a data breach or unauthorized access to the exchange's databases,\" Boehm wrote.\nHHS responded that they had no plans \"to include the specific notification procedures in the final rule. Consistent with this approach, we do not include specific policies for investigation of data breaches in this final rule.\"\nIn order to remedy the situation, Boehm says, HHS would have to devise and implement a specific department policy requiring disclosure to consumers of breaches, or an act of Congress.\nFlanigan tells Newsmax that Black will be \"pushing really hard with leadership\" to move the bill forward after the Christmas break.\nThe importance of addressing the security risks was underscored by David Kennedy, a cyber-security expert, who told CNBC that while the website may be functioning more efficiently, adequate security fixes have not been made.\n\"You're trying to rush to keep the website \u2014 the front-end that we see every day \u2014 up-and-running.

What if this had fallen into the wrong hands? It's scary. If this is happening now, how can clients of MNsure be confident their data is safe?\"\nIn November, the Oregonian reported that Cover Oregon officials committed three personal data breaches in three days. The cause of the problem apparently involved the processing of the paperwork, which included the use of a shared printer to print out individual claims. Cover Oregon is only processing paper applications because the exchange website is not able to enroll people yet.\nJustin Hadley, who logged on to the North Carolina exchange to determine his eligibility, received information about two separate individuals from South Carolina."

Other developments in the Russia probes are expected this week.\nThe Latest In The Russia Inquiry: Are Indictments Imminent?\nSome news organizations",
        "output": "are reporting \u2014 but NPR hasn't confirmed \u2014 that special counsel Robert Mueller has secured his first indictment. Other developments in the Russia probes are expected this week.\nLet's turn now to the Russia investigation. All eyes today are on a federal court in Washington, D.C. That is where Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his team of prosecutors have been presenting evidence to a grand jury, and we could be on the brink of a major development in this investigation. NPR's Ryan Lucas has been following this, and he's in our studios. Hey, Ryan.\nGREENE: So what could, in theory, happen today?\nLUCAS: Well, Special Counsel Robert Mueller of course is the man leading the investigation into Russia's interference in last year's election.\nLUCAS: A big part of his probe is the question of coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia, so did folks within Trump's orbit work with Russians to try to win the 2016 presidential race? Now, Mueller has been using a federal grand jury in Washington, D.C., since August. And on Friday night, CNN reported that the grand jury has handed down its first indictment in the Russia probe. Now, NPR has not independently confirmed that. According to CNN, there's no word on who the target is or what the charges are, but CNN and a couple of other media outlets say anyone charged could be taken into custody as early as today.\nGREENE: Which, the idea of someone being taken into custody and an indictment, that could be a significant development here, right?\nLUCAS: Most definitely. And usually in an instance like this we would learn the identity of the person being charged and what those charges are. In this case those details could shed light on the direction that Mueller's probe is going. One thing that's important to remember here, though, is that Mueller has the authority to investigate not just the so-called collusion question but really any matters that may arise during the course of his investigation. So the charges that may come down today could be totally unrelated to Russia. They could be instead related to, say, allegations of money laundering or lobbying. Remember that there have been a number of people within Trump's orbit who, you know, there are questions about lobbying work they did on behalf of foreign clients, including foreign governments.\nNow, the other thing is that the indictment is also likely an indication that Mueller and the whole Russia question, the whole Russian investigation is not going to go away anytime soon. And that, of course, is what the White House would like to see happen.\nGREENE: Well, and a lot of people are trying to figure out what President Trump was up to over the weekend. He was tweeting a lot, which is certainly not out of the ordinary over a weekend or at all, but I'm trying to figure out if he might know something or if he was tweeting maybe about this stuff because of, you know, as a sign of what's to come.\nLUCAS: Well, the president has said for quite some time that the Russian investigation is a witch hunt. That's his term for it. And he says it's organized by Democrats, of course, to kind of hamstring his presidency. On Sunday he did fire off a whole series of tweets that appear to take aim at Mueller and the investigation. He said that he's never seen such, and I quote here, \"anger and unity\" - all caps - among Republicans about a bunch of issues related to Hillary Clinton, including her emails. He said that the Democrats are using this as a, quote, \"terrible and bad for our country witch hunt for evil politics.\" Republicans are fighting back, he said, and then he added, there is so much guilt by Democrats/Clinton, and now the facts are pouring out. In all caps, \"do something.\"\nI have to add one more thing, though, and that's that his lawyer said in a statement that same day that the president's comments are unrelated to the Special Counsel's activities.\nGREENE: (Laughter). They're just tweets. He's just tweeting, is the message. And just really briefly, I mean, any idea who could be charged? Any speculation about that?\nLUCAS: There's a ton of speculation out there. Some say former campaign Chairman Paul Manafort, who's clearly been a focus of the investigation. The FBI served a search warrant on his home earlier this summer. Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn is another idea. But it could be somebody else entirely. Smaller fish, so to speak, and then investigators work their way up the chain.\nGREENE: All right. NPR's Ryan Lucas. Ryan, thanks a lot."

Hey, What\u2019s That Sound?\nIf, as the sound artist Stephan Moore likes to say, the laptop has become the 21st-century folk instrument, then the Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts in Katonah has propelled itself to the forefront of that development, commissioning and bringing to its 90-acre campus",
        "output": "an exhibition of sound art featuring 10 works by 11 laptop-wielding artists.\n\u201cIn the Garden of Sonic Delights,\u201d which opened on June 7 and will close on Nov. 2, offers works that, in the folk tradition, address global issues. But the works are also local in the most immediate sense, growing out of their creators\u2019 affinity for specific spots amid Caramoor\u2019s formidable flora and fountains, said Mr. Moore, who is curating and contributed to the show.\nA sense of place is clear in Mr. Moore\u2019s piece, \u201cDiacousticon,\u201d a playful commentary on the surveillance state, built in, over and around the Sense Circle fountain. The work refers to the philosopher Jeremy Bentham\u2019s Panopticon \u2014 an influential circular prison design that allows a single watchman to guard all the inmates \u2014 with microphones, loudspeakers and robotic instruments attached to the fountain\u2019s circular dovecote. The hardware listens and responds to ambient noise in accordance with an algorithm Mr. Moore created.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the music of it,\u201d he said.\nNot far from the fountain, on an open patch of grass near the picnic area, a piece called \u201cCoronium 3500 (Lucie\u2019s Halo)\u201d was making music that, like that of \u201cDiacousticon,\u201d was playful and reactive to the environment but distinctive in tone and timbre. Powered by the sun, the work, by Scott Smallwood, consisted of 12 devices that, around midday, emitted a chirping, beeping cacophony of melodic patterns drawn from a pentatonic musical scale.\nMr. Smallwood\u2019s focus on the sun was shared by Annea Lockwood\u2019s installation, \u201cWild Energy.\u201d But her sensibility contrasted markedly with his. Rejecting algorithms, she made solar oscillations \u2014 which had been recorded by satellites and sped up 42,000 times to make them audible to humans \u2014 the opening of a piece that wove bits of infrasound sped up, and ultrasound slowed down, into a 46-minute tapestry. (Infrasound involves sounds of less than 20 hertz, ultrasound those higher than 20,000 hertz, both outside the range of normal hearing.) Fed through speakers hidden strategically in the dense vegetation near the Cedar Walk, the piece\u2019s darkly rumbling bass overwhelmed Mr. Smallwood\u2019s bright treble tones ringing faintly in the distance.\nNo such issues detracted from Mr. Bielecki\u2019s third collaboration, \u201cWe Fall Like Light.\u201d In it, he and Laurie Anderson transformed a niche at the exhibition\u2019s far east end into a meditation on time, fashioning a modest fountain whose spout, triggered by the recorded croak of a Hudson Valley frog, adjusted the frequency of the water\u2019s flow so that, when viewed through specially adjusted strobe glasses, it appeared to be moving backward. Time seemed to be rewinding and folding in on itself, raising questions about the very nature of narrative.\nSuch questions were also fodder for Betsey Biggs, who, like Ms. Anderson, offered a watery take on nonlinear narrative. For her \u201cSunken Gardens,\u201d visitors donned headphones that amplified electromagnetic waves given off by induction loops hidden under Caramoor\u2019s sprawling Sunken Garden. As visitors strolled the garden, they happened on the buried sounds \u2014 bubbling bits, spoken-word excerpts from Jules Verne\u2019s \u201c20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\u201d and the like \u2014 piecing them together and creating their own narrative streams.\nExhibitions that plumb such depths can stretch a budget, and the $400,000 price tag for \u201cSonic Delights\u201d required some cost savings along with grants and individual contributions, said Jeffrey P. Haydon, the chief executive officer. But, he added, the exhibition will expand Caramoor\u2019s reach; five other artworks are part of the commission, each displayed at a different institution in Westchester County.\nMore to the point, perhaps, the exhibition could lead to broader programming. Mr. Haydon said that, for example, the Knights, a chamber group with wide-ranging interests, have discussed collaborating with sound artists when they play Caramoor in September.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the big, ambitious goal,\u201d Mr. Haydon said.\n\u201cIn the Garden of Sonic Delights,\u201d an exhibition of sound art, is running through Nov. 2 at the Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts, 149 Girdle Ridge Road, Katonah. Tickets: $5 to $15, children free. Information: caramoor.org or (914) 232-5035."

        "output": "her own career.\n\u201cThose of you going into journalism are arriving at a time of much greater opportunity,\u201d Kornblut told the group of students, faculty and families on the lawn of Stanford\u2019s Memorial Court.\nKornblut was part the team at the Post that won the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for coverage of NSA surveillance and Edward Snowden. She has previously worked at The New York Times, The Boston Globe and began her journalism career at the New York Daily News.\nRead Kornblut\u2019s entire speech below and on The Washington Post\u2019s website.\nANNE KORNBLUT: Thank you so much to Jay Hamilton and the Stanford Department of Communication for inviting me here today. And thank you to Jim Bettinger, of the Knight Program, for bringing me to Stanford for the last year. Most importantly, congratulations to all of you. What an achievement.\nMy first job in journalism was at the New York Daily News. It was, and is, a tabloid in the best sense of the word. We covered what we called the three Ms \u2014 murder, mayhem and Madonna. We snuck behind police lines at crime scenes. We called in tips from pay phones. And at midnight we would go to Times Square to wait for the competing papers to be delivered to a newsstand. It was a terrific first job \u2014 and a great time for newspapers, which were flush with advertising revenue and had no competition from the Internet. People look back on those years, in the mid-1990s, as a heyday for print.\nBut let me tell you this: those of you going into journalism are arriving at a time of much greater opportunity.\nOf course there are uncertainties \u2014 which you have heard all about. The decline of local news\u2026the disappearance of print advertising\u2026the proliferation of listicles, and clickbait. I\u2019m sure a few parents of graduates have watched these trends with interest.\nYou may have heard that all this technology, all this scale, is rendering traditional journalism obsolete. Anyone can post a news story on Twitter, or livestream video of an event using Periscope. Anyone can throw a document up online. And that is true. But something else is also true: often the most important stories are literally too dangerous for witnesses to just post on Facebook, or too secret for the people who know them to share. The hardest stories are ones that people cannot tell in the first person, for fear of retribution\u2026or don\u2019t want to tell, for fear they won\u2019t be believed.\nLet me give you two recent examples I had the honor of working on up close.\nThe first, Jay mentioned already. Two years ago, a young NSA contractor named Edward Snowden became outraged by what he saw working at the agency, and decided the public needed to know about widespread phone surveillance that had never been disclosed. Snowden obviously had the technical skills to write this up himself on a blog. But he believed news that explosive had to come with extra credibility. So he brought the documents to reporters, ones he sought out because he trusted them, and that he believed the world would trust, too.\nA short time after that, a colleague of mine at the Post, Carol Leonnig, started breaking stories about problems within the Secret Service. Agents were drinking on the job\u2026 or failing to do their jobs at all. A gunman shot at the White House residence while the president\u2019s daughters were home, and no one noticed until the bullet holes were found several days later. Carol\u2019s information came from people with firsthand knowledge\u2026people who took great risks to share the stories with her\u2026people who could never tell these stories themselves without being prosecuted. So Carol became the messenger. Her reporting forced a major overhaul at the Secret Service, and in my view helped make the president safer. It also won her a Pulitzer prize.\nThese are examples of what we still call real journalism \u2014 and there are so many of them for you to go and find in the years ahead.\nFirst, Listen more than you talk. This is the key to good reporting, and also a good life practice. Most importantly, it will spare you having to cringe as you listen back over interview recordings wondering why you said all those things.\nSecond, show up in person. Stories won\u2019t come looking for you. The people you interview will give you more if they know you made an effort. The same is true of bosses. I got my first full-time job by finding an empty desk in the breaking news part of the newsroom where I wanted to work \u2014 and where I had been told I couldn\u2019t get a job because I was too inexperienced. I sat there until finally one day, a story broke, and there was no one else available.\nThird, everyone knows something someday. Be polite to people.\nFourth, the news will always be there.\nOh, it\u2019s addictive, alright. On election night in 2012, I was 10 months pregnant. I was 70 pounds bigger than I am now, and six days away from my daughter being born. Everyone in the newsroom was worried that I would have the baby right there. But you know what I was worried about? Missing the next day\u2018s story, and the inauguration, and everything else that would follow. I stayed at work until 2 a.m., trying to hold on to every last thread. And you know what? I went into labor the following Monday, and returned from work 5 months later\u2026to even bigger stories, including Snowden.\nThe fear of missing out is a powerful force, and sometimes it feels like journalists invented it. We love to be where the action is. But it also takes its toll, especially in a 24-hour news cycle, and it can be a distraction from your long-term goals. Set your own priorities, follow your own gut. If it means missing a story here or there\u2026well\u2026there will always be another story.\nTHANK YOU. And congratulations, again."

The Patterson water system in Greene County is missing from the data.\nStatewide, there are more than 400,000 lead service lines and more than 300,000 copper service lines that may have been constructed with lead solder. Service lines connect the water mains in the system to buildings, like houses and businesses.\nThere are 1,911 lead service lines and 532 copper lines that may have lead solder in Brown, Cass, Greene, Morgan, Pike and Scott counties. Of South Jacksonville\u2019s 1,550 retail connections, there are 1,000 lead service lines and 400 copper lines that may have lead solder.\nLead, which was commonly used in the construction of water lines and plumbing for decades, was banned nationwide in 1986. Pipes, pipe and plumbing fixtures, solder and flux still in existence that contain lead were installed prior to the ban, more than 30 years ago.\nIn January 2017, the Illinois Environmental Protection Act was amended to require annual reporting of water distribution system material inventories by identifying the total number of service lines, the number of known lead service lines and the number of lead service lines added to the inventory year over year.\nOther types of materials used in service lines include galvanized piping, plastic and copper.\nThose numbers may be lower in next year\u2019s report. The Illinois EPA is adding material categories \u2014 ductile or cast iron and transite \u2014 which were materials inventoried as unknown for 2017\u2019s numbers.

Frank, age 54, of New York, is charged with wire fraud and money laundering in a 13-count indictment unsealed in November following an investigation by the FBI. According to the indictment, Frank was a resident of New York and a licensed attorney. The indictment alleges Frank devised a scheme to induce individuals to invest money with him for purported use in a Swiss-based loan program, knowing full well that investor funds would be diverted and used for his personal benefit and for purposes other than the Swiss loan program, including wire transfers to bank accounts held by third-party entities or individuals in China, the United Kingdom, Spain, and Canada. Frank made one or more representations to investors about the Swiss loan program, including telling them it was safe and secure; investors\u2019 principal would remain in the Swiss account throughout the loan period; and that he would pledge his law license on the security of the Swiss account and the investment. Frank also told investors they would receive a 10 or 15 percent monthly return on their investment. The indictment alleges Frank\u2019s financial arrangement was a Ponzi scheme. Frank used new investors\u2019 principal to pay old investors returns for a few months. Some investors rolled their \"returns\" back into their investment. Many investors received no returns and virtually all investors lost their principal. From around April 2007 to around November 2007, more than $1.5 million was invested with Frank for use in the Swiss loan program.\nChristopher D. Hales, age 29, of Midvale was charged in a 10-count indictment unsealed in September with mail, wire, and bank fraud, and money laundering, in connection with an alleged mortgage fraud scheme. The indictment involves two properties, one in Lindon and one in Salt Lake City. The indictment alleges Hales and other unindicted co-conspirators executed a scheme to produce income from false appraisals to artificially inflate the purchase price of residences. Hales arranged to purchase the homes through straw buyers, and took the false equity proceeds stemming from those sales for himself and his co-conspirators, according to the indictment. The case is being investigated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development - Office of Inspector General, the FBI, and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service. A six-day jury trial is set for Feb. 22, 2011, before U.S. District Judge Ted Stewart.\nJolee M, Tibbitts, 42, whose last known address was in Florida, was sentenced to 48 months in federal prison on Oct. 27, 2010, after pleading guilty to wire fraud in connection with an investment scheme involving property she claimed to own on the Island of Molokai\"s in Hawaii. Tibbitts told investors the land had been divided into five-acre parcels and that the parcels included beach front and interior properties at a price of $15,000 per parcel. She described a scheme to investors which would allow them to make a quick profit of $30,000. During the scheme period, approximately 42 investors paid her about $1.2 million. Tibbitts owned no property on Moloka\u2019i. She used approximately $187,000 of investor funds to pay back about eight investors. She used the remaining investor funds for her personal use, including purchasing a new truck, domestic travel and various other expenses. She lulled investors into a false sense of security through a series of excuses, including real estate sales take longer in Hawaii; investor money had been stolen from escrow and she needed time to sort the matter out; and sales proceeds can only be paid in small amounts. Tibbitts was ordered to pay $1,012,500 in restitution in the case.

At a time when overall enrollment in higher education is declining, the number of online students continues to climb. More than 6.3 million students took at least one online class in 2016, according to an annual analysis of federal data by the Babson Survey Research Group. That represents 32 percent of all students in higher education, up from 26 percent in 2012.\nThe expansion of online education has coincided with concerns about the price of brick-and-mortar education. And it has arrived as much-improved technology gives time-pressed, place-bound adults the flexibility to earn a degree. That flexibility has often translated to concerns from campus-based academics about the quality of online classes. But those worries seem to be subsiding. In part, that\u2019s because the big for-profit providers, which were responsible for the early growth of online education, are losing market share to traditional brand-name colleges, particularly public universities.\nEmployers are also playing a significant role in the enhancement of online education. The United States has 6 million vacant jobs \u2014 1 million in health care alone \u2014 according to the Labor Department. While employers might have been skeptical of online degrees a decade ago, today they are most worried about hiring workers with high-quality skills.\nAs hospitals increasingly require nurses to have a four-year degree, one of the most popular online degrees is the \u201cR.N. to B.S.N.,\u201d for people who are already registered nurses to earn a bachelor of nursing degree. There are 4.2 million nurses in the United States, and about one-third lack a bachelor\u2019s degree.\nOne of the largest online nursing programs is at the University of Texas at Arlington, with nearly 11,000 students \u2014 part of a broader online strategy the university has pursued over the past few decades. The school started to put courses online in the 1990s to offset a sharp drop in enrollment. By 2008, it had 5,100 students enrolled in at least one online course. That\u2019s when it partnered with Academic Partnerships, one of several companies that help nonprofit universities build online programs and recruit students.\nGiven that the largest online programs UT-Arlington offers are in nursing and education, Karbhari told me, the university can\u2019t afford to turn out low-quality online degrees. Hospitals and schools usually recruit at institutions based on their previous hiring experiences. \u201cYou\u2019re always judged on your last class of graduates,\u201d he said.\nI first became familiar with the University of Texas at Arlington in 2013, when I contributed to a project at New America, a nonpartisan public policy think tank. It studied public universities that had been able to expand enrollment and achieve higher graduation rates in a cost-effective manner. The Arlington campus was one of six selected after an analysis of federal higher-education data.\nIn the five years since that report was published, UT-Arlington\u2019s online enrollment has continued to climb, making it one of the fastest-growing universities in the country. Today, 57 percent of UT-Arlington students take at least one class online, and of those students, 45 percent are enrolled exclusively online.\nOne of the fully online students is Tara Bordeaux, who is scheduled to graduate in August with a master\u2019s degree in curriculum and instruction. Bordeaux started online courses with UT-Arlington in 2012, while working in the film industry in Los Angeles. She wanted to become certified as a teacher. Now, she teaches audio and video production, filmmaking, and photography at Lanier High School in Austin, where she was recently named teacher of the year in the state.\nBordeaux was an early pioneer in online education 20 years ago, when she took a few online courses by checking out videotapes from a community college. \u201cI felt like those were watered-down courses,\u201d she said. But with the widespread use of broadband, online courses have improved enough, Bordeaux told me, that they are often as challenging as, or in some cases more difficult than, face-to-face classes.\nIf they\u2019re only about making money, the online efforts of universities will fail. But for many colleges, online programs are part of a broader movement to ensure that students graduate with a credential. In the California State University System, more than 100,000 students choose to take at least one online course because face-to-face courses are often full and unavailable. Without the online option, it would take students longer to graduate, or many might drop out short of a degree."

They've been the subject of heated commentary on the Internet and have become fodder for jokes by late-night hosts Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien, raising questions about his prospects for a spot in an Obama administration.\nAt a July 23 speech in Houston, Edwards responded to a reporter's question about the Enquirer story by referring to it as \"tabloid trash.\"\nAfterward, he avoided waiting reporters, exiting through a side area used by the kitchen staff at Washington's historic Hotel Monaco.\nEdwards emerged near the rear of the hotel with two men. When approached by a reporter, Edwards said, \"Can't do it now, I'm sorry\" and quickly walked past.\nAsked about the Beverly Hilton, Edwards said \"sorry\" and got into a waiting car with the other men. Asked twice more to address the Enquirer story, Edwards was silent until the car doors closed.\nMcClatchy obtained the birth certificate through a routine public records request to the Santa Barbara County Recorder's Office, which provided an \"informational copy\" for a fee of $17. A certified copy, which can be used to establish identity for legal transactions, is available only to family members and government agencies.\nAsked Thursday why no father was listed on the birth certificate, Hunter's attorney, Robert Gordon of New York, said, \"A lot of women do that.\"\nReminded that he and Hunter had publicly revealed the father's identity two months earlier to the National Enquirer, Gordon said, \"That's a personal matter between them.\"\nThe certificate shows that the girl was born at Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara, Calif., to Rielle Jaya James Druck, also known as Rielle Hunter.

They need \"hands-on learning experiences\" at the earliest possible age.\nBy the time children head off to school, financial experts say, they should know the rudiments of coins and bills: putting coins together to buy, say, a 25-cent item and sub-dividing bills into $1s, $5s, $10s, and $20s.\nUp to junior high, they should learn the importance of choices. Example: A.J.'s sister, Ashley, has definite tastes in clothes. So Mrs. Manker now gives her daughter a precise clothing allowance. \"I tell her: 'Spend it any way you want,' but I remind her that that's the total clothing allowance.\"\n* Money is a tool to make good things happen, not to be feared or coveted.\n* Conservation, such as turning off lights and recycling, both cuts the family's costs and helps the environment. Such issues lift the concept of money to a sense of sharing and making a better world.\n* Responsibility counts. Look for ways to let children earn money. Ashley, for example, gets paid for doing light housework. But when she cleans a room, her mother says, \"I want it to be a thorough job,\" just like a professional cleaning person would do.\n* Be a good consumer with children. At the grocery store, compare prices. Analyze ads in magazines. Even very small children, such as Kristin Manker, not yet in school, can learn to critique TV and radio ads.\n* Most important, make money a family matter, Ms. Hogan says.\nAnd finally, don't underestimate the power and importance of an allowance. It helps kids control and understand money. - how it works; what it can and can't do.\nSome parents give enough allowance to cover certain expenses, such as clothing, movies, or trips to the video arcade. So if they want those things, they have to budget.\nOther parents let the allowance go to \"whatever.\" But it's important to let the kids count their own pennies.

They were rewarded with a world-beating rally.\nHedge funds boosted",
        "output": "their bets on price gains for bullion to an all-time high just two days before UK voters took to the polls and decided to leave the European Union, sending global markets roiling. Gold futures climbed to a two-year high after the referendum. The metal's wild ride isn't over yet. Prices could jump another 7 per cent by the end of the year, a Bloomberg survey showed.\nGold's surge shows the metal is delivering on its role as a refuge, with prices on Friday posting the biggest increase of any major global asset. The gains added to what's already been a stellar 2016 for bullion. Futures are heading for the best start to a year since 1979.\nSpeculation that the Federal Reserve will keep US interest rates low has boosted demand for the metal as a store of value, while a volatile geopolitical backdrop has increased haven buying.\nThe UK vote \"is a fundamental change, and we could see the fallout go on for quite a while,\" said Adrian Day, president of Adrian Day Asset Management in Annapolis, Maryland, which oversees US$165 million. \"There's a lot of uncertainty and conflict there, and uncertainty and conflict are good for gold.\"\nMoney managers boosted their net-long position in gold futures and options by 6.7 per cent to 256,898 contracts in the week ended June 21, according to US Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released three days later. That's the highest since the data begins in 2006. The previous record was 253,653 reached in August 2011 - just a month before gold futures touched US$1,923.70, the highest ever.\nIn New York, futures advanced 0.6 per cent to US$1,330.50 on the Comex at 12.50pm Singapore time, extending last week's 2.1 per cent increase. The metal climbed as much as 7.9 per cent on Friday, topping the gains of other major haven assets including the yen and Treasuries.\nMost global equity markets tumbled as many investors were stunned by the results of the British vote, which sparked panic on trading floors and prompted UK Prime Minister David Cameron to resign.\nPrices could reach as high as US$1,424 by the end of the year, according to the median of 12 forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of analysts and traders from New York to London conducted on Friday. That would be the highest since August 2013.\nThe precious metal has long been prized as a universal store of value immune to the whims of political leaders. The UK Royal Mint, which makes circulation and collector coins, and specialist online brokers reported surges in new customers after the Brexit vote. In London's spot gold market, the biggest in the world, prices jumped as much as 8.1 per cent, the most since the height of the global financial crisis in 2008.\nInvestors were also quick to snap up options contracts in New York betting on further price gains. On Friday, the most- traded gold option on the Comex was a call giving owners the right to buy the metal at US$1,350 by July, exchange data show. The contract, which expires Monday, more than doubled in price. The August US$1,350 call more than tripled.\nMoney has been pouring into gold all year amid increasing expectations that a volatile global growth environment will force Fed officials to hold off from raising US interest rates. Holdings in exchange-traded products backed by the metal climbed to the highest since October 2013 last week. The SPDR Gold Shares alone attracted US$10.8 billion in new money this year, the most of more than 6,000 ETPs tracked by Bloomberg.\nGold's gains in 2016 come after three straight annual losses when low inflation, a stronger dollar and an improving US job market spurred some investors to lose faith in the metal as a store of value.\nThe recent jump higher could be a \"selling opportunity,\" if the greenback continues to strengthen, said Sameer Samana, a St Louis-based global quantitative strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, which oversees US$1.8 trillion. The dollar rose as much as 0.7 per cent against a 10-currency basket on Monday.\nBut, bullion and the dollar climbed together in 2008 amid the global recession. Speculation that the world economy will sputter has spurred traders to cut the odds of a US rate increase by December to 15 per cent. That's down from 78 per cent just a month ago.\n\"Global growth, negative interest rates and the fear trade: that's what drives gold the most,\" said Frank Holmes, who oversees US$800 million as chief executive officer of US Global Investors in San Antonio, Texas."

Here's how to roll your own.\nEnlarge / Even in the download-only era, it's easy to make yourself offline OS X install media.\nIt was 2009 when Apple last released a new operating system on physical media. Things have proceeded remarkably smoothly since",

For instance, if you find yourself doing multiple installs, a USB drive may be faster than multiple downloads (especially if you use a USB 3.0 drive). Or maybe you need a recovery disk for older Macs that don't support the Internet Recovery feature. Whatever the reason, you're in luck, because it's not hard to make one.\nAs with last year, there are two ways to get it done. There's the super easy way with the graphical user interface and the only slightly less easy way that requires some light Terminal use. Here's what you need to get started.\nA Mac that you have administrator access to, duh. We've created El Capitan USB stick from both Yosemite and El Capitan, but your experience with other versions may vary.\nAn 8GB or larger USB flash drive or an 8GB or larger partition on some other kind of external drive.

The installer will delete itself when you install the operating system, but it can be re-downloaded if necessary.\nIf you want a GUI, you need the latest version of Diskmaker X app. Version 5 is the one with official El Capitan support.\nDiskmaker X is free to download, but the creator accepts donations if you want to support his efforts.\nInstall Diskmaker X to the Applications folder.\nDownload the El Capitan installer from the App Store and then select El Capitan in Diskmaker X.\nWe'll use a flash drive but you can use pretty much anything with enough free space.\nThe new version of Diskmaker supplies better progress information than the old one.\nOnce you've obtained all of the necessary materials, connect the USB drive to your Mac and run the Diskmaker X app. The app will offer to make installers for OS X 10.9, 10.10, and 10.11, and it should run on OS X versions all the way back to 10.7\u2014support for 10.6 was dropped in the most recent release.\nDiskmaker X has actually been around since the days of OS X 10.7 (it was previously known as Lion Diskmaker), and it's still the easiest GUI-based way to go without intimidating newbies. If you're comfortable with the command line, it's still possible to create a disk manually using a Terminal command, which we'll cover momentarily.\nSelect OS X 10.11 in Diskmaker X, and the app should automatically find the copy you've downloaded to your Applications folder. It will then ask you where you want to copy the files\u2014click \"An 8GB USB thumb drive\" if you have a single drive to use or \"Another kind of disk\" to use a partition on a larger drive or some other kind of external drive. Choose your disk (or partition) from the list that appears, verify that you'd like to have the disk (or partition) erased, and then wait for the files to copy over. The process is outlined in screenshots above.\nIf you don't want to use Diskmaker X, Apple has actually included a terminal command that can create an install disk for you. Assuming that you have the OS X El Capitan installer in your Applications folder and you have a Mac OS X Extended (Journaled)-formatted USB drive named \"Untitled\" mounted on the system, you can create an El Capitan install drive by typing the following command into the Terminal.\nThe command will erase the disk and copy the install files over. Give it some time, and your volume will soon be loaded up with not just the OS X installer but also an external recovery partition that may come in handy if your hard drive dies and you're away from an Internet connection.\nWhichever method you use, you should be able to boot from your new USB drive either by changing the default Startup Disk in System Preferences or by holding down the Option key at boot and selecting the drive.

Though October has only been with us for five trading sessions, the Nasdaq Composite now stands down 3.2% month to date. The Russell 2000? -3.8%. Yes, after Thursday",
        "output": "and Friday, both the Dow Jones Industrials and the S&P 500 are down for the month, as well.\nEspecially badly beaten last week were the Consumer Discretionary stocks, with the focus on multi-line retailers. Although this group did seem to rescue itself over the past couple of quarters, but now it seems to be the next group to sputter -- after housing, the autos, the airlines... You did notice last week's numbers released by Reis showing mall vacancies at their highest level since 2011, and mall rents in decline, right?\nDo we even get started talking about Information Technology? You may have noticed the Technology Select SPDR ETF (XLK) close below it's 50-day simple moving average on Friday, but did you happen to notice where the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) went? That one made short work of both the 50-day and 200-day SMA, closing the week well below both of them. Ugly is the word, but does it get even worse? Let's explore.\nNot only has the Fed Chair sounded hawkish, he seems quite comfortable with it. Markets are finding this a bit scary, so they let a little air out the tires on the long end of the Treasury curve, not to mention equity markets. In fact, according to some JP Morgan research already making the rounds this morning, Chair Powell's post-FOMC announcement press conferences alone have cost U.S. equity markets up to $1.5 trillion in aggregate value.\nYou already know, if you read me, that I have been openly pleading with the Fed to cool it for a month or two, while markets adjust to the impact of removing $50 billion worth of potential liquidity from the economy each and every month.\nThat increased level of quantitative tightening starts right now. The number is comprised of $30 billion worth of Treasury holdings, and $20 billion worth of mortgage-backed securities -- and it's not quietly running in the background. S&P 500 forward-looking valuations have fallen from 18.3x earlier this year all the way down to the 16.9x -- where they stood this weekend, according to Yardeni Research.\nThis rather sharp reduction in forward-looking valuations, which brought today's valuations nearly in line with their longer-term averages, has been camouflaged by outstanding macroeconomic performance, stand-out earnings growth, and a scarcity of available shares brought about through corporate repurchase programs.\nI have told you that over the last quarter of the year that I will be using rallies to enlarge my cash position. I am not running for the hills, and like some more famous traders, I reserve the right to change my mind on a whim, but that's how I am thinking right now -- unless this Fed Chair shows me that he \"gets it.\"\nYou do realize that the whole decade or so that central banks were easing policy, that equity and debt performed well side by side, right. So, what did you think would happen?\nAs China came back from the \"Golden Week\" holiday, the PBOC announced that it would reduce the Reserve Requirement Rate (RRR), or simply the amount of reserves that commercial banks are required to hold, by 1%, starting on October 15. This supposedly will free up 1.2 trillion yuan, or close to $175 billion, in U.S. currency. This had the effect of weakening the yuan versus the U.S. dollar, and is intended to stimulate the sagging Chinese economy.\nFor those keeping score, this is the fourth such cut made by China's central bank this year. In response to these moves, traders in Shanghai sold Chinese equities aggressively. At last glance, the Shanghai Composite was off more than 3.7% response.\nThen there is Italy. No doubt in my mind that some of the selloff at the long end of the curve in the U.S. last week was based on a perception that Italy would avoid crisis. This morning, yields on Italian sovereign debt have once again spiked, with that nation's ten-year now giving up more than at any point in the last four years.\nDon't forget the ECB's plan to wind down their quantitative easing program is still slated to reach the zero bound by the end of the year. On top of that, the ECB's re-investment plan, at this time is slated to focus on higher-quality sovereign debt -- such as German debt -- over that provided by more-troubled economies. I have my doubts about this plan running smoothly. U.S. bond markets are closed today for the bank holiday.\nI would imagine that some of this safe-haven value might find it's way back into those markets if Europe is not on board with the latest version of the Italian budget. That would make pushing upward on short-term U.S. rates that much more dangerous. You kids at the FOMC getting this? Hello. Is this thing on?\nIn recent days, I have been asked two questions by retail investors that I thought I should address. The first one was simple. I was asked why I have not written about any airlines in recent memory. The answer here is simple. I mostly write about trades that I am implementing myself, or at least considering, but may not have room on my book without moving other items around. I have just not been crazy about the airlines in a good while. While I have not recently held shares of any airline specifically, and have geared my Transports allocation toward the rails this year, I always maintain a long position in the SPDR S&P Transportation ETF (XTN) as one of my core positions as a mild hedge, just in case my other choices in this space backfire.\nFortunately, as commodity prices, rise -- and more specifically , as oil prices rise -- what is seen as higher overhead for an airline is also seen as more highly valued cargo, and in a growing economy... there is greater demand for such cargo. This is a tailwind for the rails, for the truckers and for maritime shippers.\nWhat I am trying to demonstrate here is the performance of the Dow Transports in aggregate versus the S&P 500, using the S&P 500 as a base adjusted to zero. So, the Transports, year to date are under performing the S&P 500 by 2%, even though the DJTA is up 5% for 2018. Get it?\nNow separating the Dow Jones U.S. Railroad Index (DJUSRR) from the Dow Jones U.S. Airline Index (DJUSAR), the stark difference in performance between the two becomes apparent to even the untrained eye. My longs in this space are CSX Corp (CSX) , which I have held since 2017 and is at +40%, and Union Pacific Corp (UNP) , which I have held since July +19% .\nIf I were to add another rail to these holding at this stage of the game, I would look most closely at Kansas City Southern (KSU) , Canadian National (CNI) and Canadian Pacific (CP) , due to the obvious benefit likely to be experienced by these three rails in the wake of the recent NAFTA redux (known as the USMCA).\nThe other reader question was on managing risk, and how to be agile in doing so. Many of you have commented on my use of the sale of options to raise revenue and drive lower my net basis costs on my long positions. Someone asked if I change this tactic, do I become less confident in the direction of the broader indices. The answer is absolutely, I do.\nIt is at times like this, when the Fed is being rough on markets, that you will notice me sell puts with discounted strikes without taking any equity stake in names I like.

Venezuela's Foreign",
        "output": "Ministry announced Tuesday that \"it has decided to expel the Israeli ambassador and part of the personnel of the Israeli Embassy\" to protest the Gaza operation. Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said Israel's ambassador Shlomo Cohen has been informed in writing that he and his diplomatic staff must leave Venezuela within 72 hours. He said the letter did not refer to any severing of diplomatic relations. Chavez has condemned the campaign, condemning Israelis taking part as \"murderers\" and urging Venezuela's 15,000 Jews to take a stand against the Israeli government. \"Now I hope that the Venezuelan Jewish community speaks out against this barbarism. Do it. Don't you strongly reject all acts of persecution?\" Chavez said. \"How far will this barbarism go?,\" he added in an appearance on state television. \"The president of Israel should be taken before an international court together with the president of the United States, if the world had any conscience.\" Foreign Ministry spokesman for the Hebrew media Yossi Levy issued a statement saying, \"Israel will continue to defend itself from its enemies, including Hamas and Iran, with whom Venezuela has close ties. Every country has to decide which side it is on in this war - on the side of those fighting terror or those supporting it. It is no surprise that Venezuela has again shown the world what side it is on.\" Chavez's expulsion of the Israeli ambassador went one step further than his actions during the Second Lebanon War, when he recalled his country's charg\u00c3\u00a9 d'affaires from Tel Aviv. Israel responded to that move by temporarily recalling Cohen. Diplomatic officials said there had been almost no contact between the embassy and the Venezuelan government in recent years, and that the embassy deals primarily with the non-governmental sector in the country, as well as with its Jewish community. Hamas expressed its appreciation Wednesday for the move and taunted Egypt and Jordan for maintaining their relations with Israel. \"As we look with great satisfaction at this courageous step, we are surprised and deplore that some Arab countries still allow the Israeli ambassador to remain in their capitals,\" the group said in a statement. Jerusalem, meanwhile, is bracing for the possibility that Ecuador, one of Venezuela's three main allies in the region, may follow suit. Venezuela's other main allies in Latin America are Nicaragua and Bolivia, none of whom have ambassadors in Israel. Diplomatic officials said, however, there was little fear of a snowball effect that would impact relations with key players in the region such as Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Peru or Mexico.

Ditto for \"Extras,\" which used celebrity cameos to tackle the superficiality of stardom and gaining fame through too many cheap laughs.\nGervais should seriously consider sticking to his formula: Declare victory and leave after Sunday\u2019s Golden Globes \u2013 or risk becoming a parody of himself.\nDon't get us wrong: His great stints over the last two years punctured the Hollywood egos mushrooming in every corner of the Beverly Hilton. Gervais knows he\u2019s there to entertain the anonymous folks at home, not the big names in the crowd. His approach takes on an almost performance art aspect \u2013 he\u2019s running the game while mocking the players and the absurdity of awards season.\nHis takedowns last year of everyone from Mel Gibson (\"I like a drink as much as the next man \u2013 unless the next man is Mel Gibson.\") to Bruce Willis (\"Please welcome Ashton Kutcher's dad!\u201d) to Hollywood Foreign Press Association head Philip Berk (\"I just had to help him off the toilet and pop his teeth in.\u201d) sparked a controversy that's built anticipation over the last year leading to Sunday night's show.\nWe expect Gervais to come out swinging.

He's made Pilkington the star of an unlikely comedy travel show, and cast a dwarf to star in his latest effort, \"Life's Too Short.\" He's appeared in some movies (including the underappreciated \"The Invention of Lying\") and has offered a variation on standup that isn\u2019t about telling jokes as much as offering observations on everything from Humpty Dumpty to Noah's Ark, with much unprintable material in between."

        "input": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration is exploring how to dismantle or bypass Obama-era constraints intended to prevent civilian deaths from drone attacks, commando raids and other counterterrorism missions outside conventional war zones like Afghanistan and Iraq, according to officials familiar with internal deliberations.\nAlready, President Trump has granted a Pentagon request",
        "output": "to declare parts of three provinces of Yemen to be an \u201carea of active hostilities\u201d where looser battlefield rules apply. That opened the door to a Special Operations raid in late January in which several civilians were killed, as well as to the largest-ever series of American airstrikes targeting Yemen-based Qaeda militants, starting nearly two weeks ago, the officials said.\nMr. Trump is also expected to sign off soon on a similar Pentagon proposal to designate parts of Somalia to be another such battlefield-style zone for 180 days, removing constraints on airstrikes and raids targeting people suspected of being militants with the Qaeda-linked group the Shabab, they said.\nInside the White House, the temporary suspension of the limits for parts of Yemen and Somalia is seen as a test run while the government considers whether to more broadly rescind or relax the Obama-era rules, said the officials, who described the internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.\nThe move to open the throttle on using military force \u2014 and accept a greater risk of civilian casualties \u2014 in troubled parts of the Muslim world comes as the Trump administration is also trying to significantly increase military spending and cut foreign aid and State Department budgets.\nThe proposal to cut so-called soft-power budgets, however, is meeting with stiff resistance from some senior Republicans on Capitol Hill, as well as from top active-duty and retired generals and admirals, who fear perpetual conflicts if the root causes of instability and terrorism are not addressed.\nIn a sign of mounting concern over the government\u2019s policy review, more than three dozen members of America\u2019s national security establishment have urged Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to maintain the thrust of the Obama-era principles for counterterrorism missions, saying strict standards should be maintained for using force outside traditional war zones.\nThe former officials, in a letter sent on Sunday to Mr. Mattis, warned that \u201ceven small numbers of unintentional civilian deaths or injuries \u2014 whether or not legally permitted \u2014 can cause significant strategic setbacks,\u201d increasing violence from militant groups or prompting partners and allies to reduce collaboration with the United States.\nIndeed, immediately after the Special Operations raid on Jan. 29, Yemeni officials suspended further commando missions, pending an assessment of what went wrong, although they later backtracked.\nThe letter\u2019s 37 signatories included John E. McLaughlin, who was the acting C.I.A. director for President George W. Bush; Lisa O. Monaco, President Barack Obama\u2019s Homeland Security and counterterrorism adviser; and Matthew G. Olsen, who served as a national security official in the Bush Justice Department and as the director of the National Counterterrorism Center in the Obama administration.\nThe White House did not respond to a request for an interview about this article.\nMr. Obama imposed the civilian-protection rules in May 2013 as part of an effort to recalibrate counterterrorism operations after he had overseen a steep increase in military and C.I.A. drone strikes in places like Yemen and tribal Pakistan.\nCritics, including inside the government, worried that the strikes were causing too many civilian casualties, driving terrorist recruitment and undermining support among local partners in the regions. In response, the Obama administration developed the rules, known as the Presidential Policy Guidance.\nUnder those rules, cabinet officials generally must agree in high-level deliberations that a proposed target away from a traditional war zone poses a threat to Americans. That is intended to limit strikes targeting generic groups of suspected low-level foot soldiers. And there must be \u201cnear certainty\u201d that no civilians will be killed.\nBy contrast, in a standard war zone, military commanders can approve a strike without interagency review in Washington, and some civilian casualties are acceptable under the laws of war, as long as they are deemed necessary and proportionate to a legitimate military objective.\nMilitary operators have chafed under the 2013 rules, but the Obama administration saw them as a signature accomplishment in the era of drones and open-ended war on terrorism. In his last year in office, Mr. Obama issued an executive order requiring the government to disclose annually its official estimate of civilian and combatant deaths from counterterrorism airstrikes away from war zones.\nStill, in its final year in power, the Obama administration declared the area around Surt, Libya, to be an \u201carea of active hostilities.\u201d It then started a sustained campaign of 495 airstrikes targeting Islamic State militias there. Mr. Obama revoked the Surt declaration hours before Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration.\nThe Obama administration also permitted the Defense Department to carry out an escalated campaign of airstrikes last year in Somalia that the United States Africa Command started without going through the process laid out by the 2013 rules. Instead, those airstrikes were justified under an expansive theory of collective self-defense to protect African Union and Somali forces being trained and advised by the United States.\nAgainst that backdrop, officials said, both the Central Command, which oversees military activity in Yemen, and Africa Command, which oversees it in Somalia, had already been developing proposals by mid-2016 to ask for parts of Yemen and Somalia to be declared active-hostilities zones, officials said. They submitted those to the Joint Chiefs of Staff\u2019s \u201cJ5\u201d directorate, which handles strategic plans and policy.\nAs a result, the Pentagon was in a position to swiftly bring the ideas forward to Mr. Trump, whose inauguration raised expectations that the White House would be more permissive. The officials said that Mr. Mattis signed one-page memos to Mr. Trump asking for each authority, backed by about five pages of supporting material, within days of Mr. Trump\u2019s becoming president in January.\nSeveral officials said Mr. Trump signed off on making parts of Yemen an active-hostilities zone at the same dinner with Mr. Mattis five days after his inauguration where he approved the ill-fated raid on a Qaeda compound in Yemen. At the time, they said, the expectation was that the Somalia proposal would be swiftly signed, too, and that the larger 2013 rules could be jettisoned swiftly.\nOn Jan. 28, Mr. Trump signed a presidential national security memorandum directing the military to give him a plan within 30 days to defeat the Islamic State. It said the plan should include \u201crecommended changes to any United States rules of engagement and other United States policy restrictions that exceed the requirements of international law regarding the use of force,\u201d a veiled reference to rescinding the 2013 limits on airstrikes.\nBut the momentum for rapid change broke, the officials said, after the Yemen raid, which resulted in numerous civilian deaths, including of children; the death of a member of the Navy\u2019s SEAL Team 6 and the wounding of three others; and the loss of a $75 million aircraft.\nAs a result, Mr. Trump\u2019s national security advisers \u2014 first Michael T. Flynn, who has since resigned, and now Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster \u2014 have slowed the review process down while letting operations in Yemen, and soon Somalia, play out as test runs, the officials said."

        "output": "its set of planned economic reforms, including the crucial GST and cuts down on the bureaucratic cost of doing business, a top World Bank economist has said.\n\"If the changes that we saw thus far can be kept up and strengthened a little, it is not impossible for India to be in top 100 (ranking of the ease of doing business report) by next year,\" the World Bank Chief Economist and Senior Vice President, Kaushik Basu told PTI.\n\"There are countries which have moved 30-40 places at one go, but usually these are small countries. For a big economy like India, it is difficult, but from what we have seen thus far, it is not impossible,\" Basu said after the World Bank in its report released yesterday said that India jumped 12 places in the ease of doing business from 142 last year to 130 this year.\nBasu, who served as the top economic advisor during the previous Manmohan Singh government, described this as a \"remarkable achievement\" for a country of the size of Indian economy and that too in the first year of the reform.\n\"We have usually seen in other countries when the reforms start, in the first year, you get a small movement then in the second and third year, you get a big movement. And India had a reasonably substantial movement in the first year itself. So one is very hopeful,\" he said.\nHowever, he felt there is still a long way to go.\n\"There is a lot of serious interest in India to cut down bureaucratic costs of doing business for small and medium-sized firms. It is important however to recognise that this is just a start. There is still a long way to go,\" he said.\nResponding to a question, Basu said there are three areas where India needs reforms and initiatives.\n\"First, India needs to cut down transactions costs and the bureaucratic hurdles it places on individuals and small enterprises. As I just said, there is reason for optimism on this,\" he said.\n\"Second, India needs better infrastructure--roads, railways, ports. There has already been improvement in infrastructural investment. But the momentum needs to be kept up,\" he added.\n\"And, third, is inclusiveness. India is a diverse society and you have to have policies so that all groups feel included, and part of society. This entails health and educational interventions for the disadvantaged,\" he said.\n\"Inclusiveness goes beyond economics, but, done well, it can yield rich dividends for the economy,\" he said.\nGoing back to economic reforms, Basu said there are a couple of big ticket items on the agenda. He described the Goods and Services Tax (GST) as the biggest one.\n\"If, India can move so that by next year, after the budget, you have a GST in place, that can make a very big difference. It will not be a perfect GST to start with but it should be possible to make amendments and improve it over time,\" he said.\n\"Here is one very simple statistic. In India, a truck carrying freight goes from one city to another spends on average 60 per cent of the time stationary; and the bulk of that time is because of check posts, doing paper work, paying taxes and levie,\" Basu said.\n\"Once the GST is in place, India can very easily have a rule that there will be no check posts on the way. All charges will be paid at the source or at the destination,\" Basu said indicating implementation of GST would help considerable improvement in ease of doing business ranking.\nObserving that the design of economic policy requires a lot of skillful professional thought, Basu said luckily, there are very good professionals - Raghuram Rajan, Arvind Subramanian, to name just two - in the Indian government.\n\"They must be used to design policy better. And it should use people not just from those in government. There is excellent skill in India's universities, the Delhi School of Economics, Indian Statistical Institute, Indira Gandhi Institute. India needs to give voice to these professionals and their independent voices,\" he said.\nConsidered as the top world economist, Basu said India's economy is looking very good.\n\"In the World Bank's table of growth projections for major economies in the world India is topping the list for this the next year. Something similar is true of IMF projections. I do not think this has happened before. The Indian economy has some deep strengths and must continue to build on them,\" he said.\n\"But as I said before, we do not live by the economy alone. We have to attend to several diverse reforms and an active policy of inclusiveness and the promotion of shared prosperity,\" Basu said."

It has contributed to keeping him well ahead of his rivals in national presidential polls and surveys of states with early primary contests such as New Hampshire and South Carolina.\nEven negative coverage can be a boon to Trump, helping to firm up his base of supporters and communicate his wildly popular brand of straight-talking, anti-establishment conservatism that he punctuates with unapologetically outrageous statements.\nTrump\u2019s proposal to bar Muslims from the U.S. came at a point when his media coverage had faded. Prior to those comments, the number of times he was being mentioned on television compared to other candidates was at its lowest point in months, according to data compiled by The GDelt Project, which monitors news coverage.\nAnd it came on the heels of a poll in Iowa that showed Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) surging past Trump to claim his first lead of the cycle in an early-voting state.\nMany Republicans viewed Trump\u2019s proposal as a calculated effort to recapture the spotlight and stake out the far-right position on an issue that animates the base.\nThey believe the media has fallen into his trap.\nTrump\u2019s media dominance is hurting the other candidates who have to spend valuable campaign dollars on ads that have, for the most part, produced only small returns on investment.\nTrump has spent only $300,000 on a series of radio ads in early-voting states, a stunningly small amount for a candidate who has spent months atop the polls.\nBy comparison, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and a supporting super-PAC have spent more than $30 million on ads so far this cycle. Bush\u2019s poll numbers are in the single digits.\nBut there\u2019s little reason for Trump to spend on additional advertising when he\u2019s already on television at all hours.\nFollowing Trump\u2019s proposal Monday \u2014 which was nothing more than a short paragraph released by his campaign in a statement emailed to reporters \u2014 he did an interview with Greta Van Susteren on Fox News. He then received coverage of his rally later that day from every major cable news outlet.\nTrump followed that up with phone calls into shows on Fox News, MSNBC, ABC and CNN, some of them lasting a half hour or more. MSNBC replayed its phone interview with Trump later in the day.\nRepublicans see a double standard in Trump coverage. No other candidate has a standing offer to call in for interviews, particularly on the Sunday news shows. But Trump \u2014 who pulls massive ratings for the networks \u2014 does that regularly from Trump Tower in New York City.\n\u201cThe [media and Trump] are obsessed with each other to the detriment of the other candidates, and thoughtful voters, frankly,\u201d Gail Gitcho, a former spokeswoman for Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal\u2019s presidential campaign, said in an email. Jindal dropped out last month.\nThat frustration is also boiling over once again among the GOP contenders who have long taken issue with the media\u2019s focus on Trump.\nThis week, Bush scolded reporters in New Hampshire, saying that his proposals to defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and deal with Syrian refugees were being ignored.\nAnd businesswoman Carly Fiorina, another GOP candidate, directly accused Trump of floating his controversial proposal because of the poll that showed Cruz passing him in Iowa.\nThose are sentiments shared by many conservatives, who worry that one of the most experienced field of candidates the party has ever put forth is being wasted by the media\u2019s obsession with a showman leveraging his unique set of skills to hijack the process.\nThe explosive comments tossed aside the gun control debate and the focus on the terror attack in San Bernardino, Calif., which had dominated news coverage in the days before.\n\u201cThe nation was hit by a terrorist attack less than seven days ago. For five days, the country and its press focused on the killers,\u201d Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly said on her Tuesday night show.\n\u201cOn the sixth day, Donald Trump decided he\u2019d like to get back into the media headlines.\nStill, Kelly acknowledged that she opened her own show with an extended segment that focused on Trump\u2019s Muslim remarks.\nThe sum total has media giants, and even some of Trump\u2019s rivals, lauding his mastery of the media.\n\u201cThe fact that Trump now owns the media \u2014 and this episode is just more proof of it \u2014 is one aspect that has everything else in this campaign turned upside down,\u201d said conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh on his Wednesday show.\nArmstrong Williams, a close friend of Republican presidential hopeful Ben Carson who hosts a conservative political radio talk show and owns several television stations, said Trump is just playing the game better than anyone else.\n\u201cHe\u2019s the front-runner and he\u2019s surging like never before, and the media doesn\u2019t know what to do with him, so you can\u2019t blame him for getting headlines for saying outrageous things,\u201d Williams said."

If you're not familiar, the Cronut is the hourslong-line inspiring croissant-doughnut hybrid from the Dominique Ansel Bakery in New York City.\n\"People kept telling us we should make a Cronut,\" says Enoch Simpson, who is chef and owner of Endgrain with his brother Caleb. \"When Caleb told me about his idea [for the Doughscuit], I actually giggled. I was like, 'What, dude?' \"\nIt took some experimentation, but eventually Caleb figured it out. Enoch took a bite.\n\"Whoa,\" he said to his brother. \"What the hell did you just do?\"\nDoughscuits divided into 1/4 \"you're in denial about how much you're eventually going to eat\" portions.\nLook, nothing against the Cronut. The free market proved it was a good idea when scalpers started selling them at a 600 percent markup.\nBut the Cronut has an FAQ page. The Cronut has a little \"R\" in a circle next to its name. The Cronut is the kind of pastry that corrects you that, no, that's not champagne \u2014 only sparking wine from the region called Champagne can truly be called champagne.\nLook for us nationwide as well, but please be wary that if you don't see the Dominique Ansel Bakery affiliation, it is not a Cronut\u00ae.\nThe doughscuit is more humble. It's got a hardworking biscuit for a dad, not a fancy croissant. It doesn't have the little \u00ae next to its name. All it should have next to its name, forever, is an exclamation point."

He said afterward that he felt",
        "output": "100 percent, and Sabres coach Phil Housley was optimistic when asked about McCabe's status for Thursday.\n\"Today's practice was a good measure,\" Housley said. \"There was a lot of battling and he looked great out there.\"\nThe Sabres are still without Zach Bogosian, who remains day-to-day after leaving Buffalo's game against New York last Friday with a lower-body injury. Justin Falk is also day-to-day after missing practice on Tuesday. Housley said he does not expect Falk to practice Wednesday.\nWith Bogosian and Falk absent, the Sabres practiced with seven defensemen: McCabe, Nathan Beaulieu, Rasmus Ristolainen, Victor Antipin, Marco Scandella, Josh Gorges and Matt Tennyson.\nScandella is returning from offseason hip surgery, and while he has practiced regularly, he did not play in the preseason. He has not been confirmed to play Thursday, but Housley offered a promising update following practice.\n\"Marco's been doing great,\" Housley said. \"We said it was going to be a process with him and his progress is going in a great direction. These last two practices were pretty intense, there was a lot of battle but he looked great out there so that's promising.\"\nMcCabe skated on a pair with Antipin, marking the first time they've worked as a defensive unit in camp. While Antipin is still growing accustomed to North America and the English language in general, McCabe said there were no hiccups through one day on the ice.\n\"We actually talked a ton out there,\" McCabe said. \"We communicated well. I thought our switches in our D-zone went well. I think it's really come along for him, and I think you can see it throughout camp, how his confidence is rising.\"\nMcCabe averaged a career-high 20:42 last season and scored three goals and 17 assists for 20 points. His shorthanded goal against Carolina in Buffalo's preseason opener on Sept. 18, when he joined the rush and scored from the left faceoff circle, showed room for offensive growth in Housley's system.\nWhile the Sabres may have to wait a bit longer before their defense returns to full strength, McCabe's return is a step in the right direction.\n\"Today was a good day,\" he said. \"Coach Housley is the one in charge of the lineup, but it was nice to get back out with the boys.\"\nIt will be a new experience for Beaulieu on Thursday night, facing his former team in the Montreal Canadiens. Beaulieu was drafted by Montreal in 2011 and spent parts of five professional seasons with the Canadiens prior to being acquired by the Sabres in June.\nBeaulieu said at the time of the trade that he knew his time in Montreal had come to an end, and he admitted to having a chip on his shoulder on Tuesday.\n\"I definitely have a chip on my shoulder,\" he said. \"I was in Montreal for quite some time and developed a good relationship with a lot of people there \u2026 Obviously there's some emotions involved. The biggest thing is just for me to go out there and play my game. There's no friends over there now.\"\nWhile their top unit remained the same, Phil Housley tweaked his second power-play unit for practice on Tuesday. Seth Griffith joined Jason Pominville and Evander Kane down low, while Antipin joined Beaulieu at the point.\nHousley said Antipin's puck-moving abilities and offensive instincts make him a good fit on the man advantage.\n\"He knows when to jump in the holes, he's pretty smart that way,\" Housley said. \"When he scored his goal he jumped up the ice and found a little pocket there, and he's a tremendous passer. He's just got to try to use his fundamentally good skills in that respect and get shots to the net.\""

Another was a photograph from that day, proof of what Bramm for a while believed was only an urban legend: a couple holding hands as they jumped.\nSo when off-off-Broadway theater group The Present Company asked Bramm to write a response piece to the tragedy, he created Lovers Leapt. His director in New York City was Scott RC Levy.\nNow performing arts director at the Fine Arts Center Theatre Company, Levy was walking through the FAC museum when Bramm's play suddenly popped into his head. A glance at Joellyn Duesberry's World Trade Center paintings brought Bramm's \"short jewel of a piece\" to mind, and the idea of performing the play in front of the artwork was born.\n\"The play is a perfect companion piece to the art,\" Levy says. \"And it's a wonderful way to connect the theater and the gallery.\"\nDuesberry has an intimate connection with the tragedy. The Denver artist received a grant in the '90s to study and paint cityscapes in New York City. Provided a studio on the 91st floor of the North Tower, she painted scenes of the city from her window for five months.\nThe artist who replaced Duesberry in the program was killed in the attacks.\nThree of Duesberry's paintings will serve as a backdrop for Lovers Leapt, along with a scene she painted of Ground Zero years later. The actors in the short two-character play will represent both victims of the tragedy and, standing on two blocks, the towers themselves. Levy hopes that viewers will connect to the event in a different way by seeing what the experience may have been like inside the building.\n\"It's what's going on inside their heads,\" says Steve Emily, who plays one of the lovers. \"Lots of 'what-ifs.'\"\n\"These two people had wanted to connect,\" says Bramm, describing the plot of the play. \"But for reasons of their own, they never did. It's about not putting off love; don't wait for tomorrow.\"\nAlthough the subject matter is naturally sad, both actors say there is also humor and lightness. \"For me, the takeaway is hope,\" says Kara Whitney, who plays the second ill-fated lover. \"It's about saying you love the people you love, and not taking anything for granted.\"\nIn an ambitious performance, visiting expert Tina Packer explores Shakespeare's take on women."

The problem, however, is that it can be hard to discern whether investors are greedy or fearful or somewhere in between.\nPast surveys",
        "output": "have indicated that investors often say they are fearful but still act as though they are very optimistic.\nThe current bull market, which entered its ninth year in March, has arguably been one of the most hated, and that longstanding skepticism has been credited as a force behind its longevity. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.10% climbed even as investors remained skeptical about the economy, earnings and, more recently, lofty valuations. The index was in record territory Monday, up 0.3%, and has rallied 13% since the end of 2016.\nBut as the main indexes continue to hit records, investor optimism has started to rise as well. So is some fearfulness justified?\nAnalysts at Bank of America Merril Lynch, in a recent note, said that sell-side optimism levels\u2014a contrarian indicator\u2014remained at six-year highs by the end of September.\nThe Merrill research team\u2019s model looks at the consensus of sell-side optimism and pessimism levels in relation to the 15-year rolling average to see the change in trend. A reading above the red line is a \u201csell\u201d signal and a reading below the green line is a \u201cbuy\u201d signal. According to this model, the sentiment, while improved, remains below the \u201cdanger zone,\u201d and therefore implies positive returns in the near future.\nOn the other hand, another model that instead uses a four-year rolling average, instead of 15, is flashing a clear sell signal, they said.\n\u201cTypically, when four-year rolling sentiment reaches highs, the average 12-month forward return is very weak\u2014less than 1%, and there is a 49% chance that it will be negative,\u201d said Dan Suzuki, equity and quant strategist at Bank of America Merill Lynch.\n\u201cIn isolation, this particular indicator does not have much weight, after all, statistically it\u2019s a coin flip that it would be negative. But taken together with all the surveys showing improving optimism, it suggests that we should be cautious,\u201d Suzuki said.\nSuch view is in line with Bank of America\u2019s macro analysts, who last week said that the reason to be bearish on U.S. stock is that there is no reason to be bearish.\n\u201cFrom the economic environment point of view, we\u2019ve had a prolonged time that was ideal for stocks: interest rates were low, volatility was low and we saw improving earnings growth. But all of that is changing now. Interest rates are rising and earnings peaked in the first quarter,\u201d said Suzuki.\n\u201cFrom the sentiment point of view, investors moved out of skepticism and are solidly in optimism territory, which historically has been less bullish for stocks,\u201d Suzuki said."

Roger Bobb, assistant director on most of Tyler Perry\u2019s box-office-topping films and director/executive producer of Girlfriends\u2019 Getaway, had nothing but praise for the film production and acting talent he found here.\nThe majority of the cast and crew of Girlfriends\u2019 Getaway were from T&T, unusual for an American movie shot in the Caribbean.\nIn front of the camera, notable T&T performers include Spencer, Brett Bengochea as a smooth lawyer trying to court one of the women, and Renaldo Frederick as a dopey, weed-dealing henchman\u2014one of the comedic highlights.\nBehind the camera, Sheldon Felix was director of photography, giving the movie a bright and colourful cast that was helped by the beauty of the locations, which included Maracas Beach, an upscale home in Bayshore, and various parts of Chaguaramas.\nAmerican screenwriter Cas Sigers-Beedles told reporters the movie \u201cfeels very Trinidadian,\u201d and she\u2019s right. The American producers, as others have in the past, could have shot the film to make the island come across generic or, worse yet, like Jamaica.\nBut there are very distinct T&T markers in the film: undiluted accents; David Rudder\u2019s Trini 2 De Bone playing as the main characters exit the airport, a T&T flag behind them; soca artist Olatunji Yearwood performing at a fete; Daren Ganga playing cricket; and wining, mas-design and doubles-eating competitions.\nTrinidadian Lisa Wickham, one of the producers on Girlfriends\u2019 Getaway who was also supervising producer for the Canadian/T&T 2012 hybrid Home Again, talks about the potential for developing the local filmmaking industry through what she calls \u201cblended projects\u201d or collaborations with other countries\u2014and she may be on to something.\nForeign film producers give local talent access to a larger audience. Local crew members and actors get the chance to learn from more experienced foreign talent. And the foreigners save money by using local staff and settings.\nGirlfriends\u2019 Getaway was shot entirely in Trinidad, even a few early scenes that ostensibly took place in Atlanta. Other than the four main characters, the Americans in these scenes were played by Trinidadians, including Kearn Samuel as a dastardly boyfriend and Cecilia Salazar as a yoga instructor.\nGirlfriends\u2019 Getaway is a low-budget TV movie, but a film doesn\u2019t have to be big budget or in award contention to be good for local talent.\nAnother thing: A couple of local filmmakers told me that including white main characters would make a film more likely to have success abroad. Besides being stunningly cynical and self-hating, this view ignores the potential of niche audiences, including the sizable black audience in the US, Canada and other parts of the world.\nGirlfriends\u2019 Getaway premiered over the weekend on TV One, a US television network catering to a black audience, to record ratings, according to director Roger Bobb.\nThe success of Nollywood and Tyler Perry movies attests to the power of this audience. T&T films can also tap a Caribbean diaspora audience and, of course, an audience within the region.\nLooking at Girlfriends\u2019 Getaway critically, there\u2019s much to nitpick. Many aspects of the script break the bonds of credulity and it uses a lot clich\u00e9d themes and emotional devices.\nBut I don\u2019t think anyone expects intellectual rigour from a film like Girlfriends\u2019 Getaway, which was quickly shot in June and seems fashioned in the Tyler Perry mould.\nIt\u2019s technically well-made and good for a few laughs.\nIt\u2019s meant to be a fun, light way for family or friends to pass 80 minutes or so together\u2014and it is."

Matt Forte is no Walter Payton or Adrian Peterson, but he\u2019s more adept at busting the occasional long run than he is running between the tackles. Chicago needs to give Forte a chance to break that long run with two or three run calls on third-and-medium.

        "output": "Salvini was reproached by the press and rival politicians, and many took it as a worrying sign of fascism\u2019s creeping return to Italian politics. But the same sentiment\u2014an exaltation of enemies, whether liberals, immigrants or \u201ccultural Marxists\u201d\u2014can be seen across the world, as domestic politics becomes increasingly polarised.\nIn this febrile atmosphere, it\u2019s no surprise the ideas of German legal theorist Carl Schmitt are, in the words of the Financial Times, \u201cback in vogue.\u201d A celebrated scholar, an avowed and unrepentant Nazi supporter and a Mussolini sympathiser, Schmitt saw politics as a constant combat between warring factions. Enemies\u2014real enemies, the ones who\u2019d be happy to see you dead\u2014are essential to political identities, Schmitt thought. If they did not exist, they would need to be invented. \u201cTell me who your enemy is, and I will tell you who you are,\u201d he said. Without enemies, he thought, we are nothing.\nFor decades after the Second World War, Schmitt\u2019s anti-Semitism put him beyond the pale of serious scholarship, and he was never allowed to teach at German universities again. But since his death in 1985, age 97, Schmitt\u2019s stature has grown. According to Jan-Werner Muller, professor of politics at Princeton University, he is \u201cthe [twentieth] century\u2019s most brilliant enemy of liberalism.\u201d The real worry today is not his rehabilitation\u2014but his relevance.\nArguably Schmitt\u2019s most influential work was The Concept of the Political, a short essay with a lasting legacy, recognised as one of the most important tracts of modern political thought. Published in 1932, a year before he joined the Nazi Party, Schmitt\u2019s essay starts from a simple premise: If the defining distinction in morality is between good and evil, in aesthetics between beauty and ugliness, and in economics between profitable and unprofitable, what then is the defining distinction in politics?\nAs the rhetoric of war suffuses Britain today, it\u2019s often diagnosed as a symptom of Brexiteers\u2019 hankering nostalgia for Britain\u2019s past. But Schmitt\u2019s work shows that war serves another purpose in the political imagination: it binds people together, and brings with it a sense of purpose and belonging. War creates a cohesive identity; as the enemy comes clearly into view, so do we.\nThis rallying fantasy is innate to nationalist movements. Immigration is relayed in the language of \u201cinvasion.\u201d Internal opponents are attacked on the grounds of \u201ctreason.\u201d Other enemies, including leftists and minorities, are construed as wanting to wreck the nation. In Hungary, the name of Prime Minister Viktor Orban\u2019s party Fidesz evokes the Latin fides; fidelity, or loyalty. At Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s inauguration, the former military captain held up a Brazilian flag and declared that it would \u201cnever be red, unless our blood is needed to keep it yellow and green.\u201d It\u2019s not only Brexiteers who have war in their dreaming.\nIn a world where strong social bonds and feelings of belonging are elusive, the psychological certainties of war offer perverse relief. Schmitt saw a similar alienation plaguing his own era. His belief that liberalism was to blame has always resonated with left-wing thinkers, from Walter Benjamin to Slavoj Zizek. He praised Marx for his \u201cmighty friend-enemy grouping\u201d between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. But his focus on foreign threats has ensured that Schmitt\u2019s natural heirs are almost all on the right.\nWith prescient words, Schmitt attacked liberalism\u2019s \u201conslaught against the political.\u201d The doe-eyed denial of the friend-enemy distinction\u2014which sought to replace conflict with economic competition and \u201cperpetual discussion\u201d\u2014ended not in utopia, Schmitt argued, but in the dispiriting diktat that \u201cthere must no longer be political problems, only organizational-technical and economic-sociological ones.\u201d This foreshadowed, some fifty years early, Fukuyama\u2019s \u201cEnd of History\u201d thesis, but without any of the end of century optimism. Schmitt believed that in a world where enemies were prohibited, wars would be far worse.\nSchmitt's own Nazi Party disproved the theory that wars would be worse when nations had no enemies, although the liberal-led nuclear age has threatened to affirm his idea. Yet Schmitt\u2019s critique of liberalism\u2019s duplicity remains eerily prescient. He laid out the \u201cmanifest fraud\u201d of those who declare the inhumanity of war while waging it. \u201cThe worst confusion arises,\u201d Schmitt warned, \u201cwhen concepts such as justice and freedom are used to legitimise one\u2019s own political ambitions and to disqualify or demoralize the enemy.\u201d Politics was no place for experts.\nWhat Schmitt saw\u2014and what, in his anti-Semitism, he succumbed to\u2014is the attraction of enmity. With little else to latch on to, in either economic or social spheres, adversity injects real meaning into life. For Schmitt, \u201cthe entire life of a human being is a struggle and every human being symbolically is a combatant\u201d. The lure of this idea can be seen everywhere today, from the popularity of Jordan Peterson and Joe Rogan, pseudo-intellectuals who see the same fraught world in which man (and it is almost always men) must fight for himself, to, more playfully, social media boasts of being blocked, and the current trend of \u201cNemesis Twitter,\u201d where users vaunt unnamed foes, affirming a strong identity by extension.\nBrexit is many things, but it is partly a search for enemies. There\u2019s a sense in which British society had become sterile and enfeebled. Brexit was a chance to restore its power. The EU was a perfect foil for this sentiment; framed in the right way, it represented three enemies in one: old continental rivals, namely Germany and France; immigrants with malign intentions; and an elite bureaucracy, untethered to any nation.\nDuring the referendum, all of these \u201cenemies\u201d\u2014 enticingly wrapped up within a single institution \u2014 were said to embody wild, existential threats. The EU was compared to Hitler 2.0, eastern Europeans and refugees became potential ISIS terrorists, and even the most treasured of national traditions were at risk of annihilation by Brussels. \u201cTHE EUROPEAN UNION WANTS TO KILL OUR CUPPA,\u201d one Leave campaign Facebook ad shrieked.\nBrexit is often cast as a peculiarly British affliction\u2014a post-imperial melancholy, a world war nostalgia, a delusion of grandeur\u2014even as right-wing populism sweeps the world. But Brexit is actually more Schmittish than British. It stems from an obsession with sovereignty, an aggressive affirmation of identity and a wannabe-war with existential enemies.\nThis politics plagues every nation, and is why Brexit\u2014despite its solipsistic patriotism\u2014finds such support abroad, whether in Salvini, Trump or the Alternative fur Deutschland. Really, nationalism knows no borders, and all nationalists speak the same language. Schmitt may as well have written their script."

First, 2018 has been designated Barbados\u2019s Year of Culinary Experiences. Second, the cuisine is a perfect illustration of the amazing diversity you\u2019ll find on this little tropical island.\nYou can tick all the boxes when it comes to dreamy beaches, swaying coconut palms, idyllic hotels and a sea painted every colour of blue.\nYet Barbados has so much more depth than just being a premium fly-and-flop destination. You could spend a whole week investigating the intriguing historical monuments, grand plantation houses and exquisite botanical gardens. Or another week combining forays into the rainforest with a clutch of water sports. And yet another week shopping for crafts, playing golf and indulging in spa treatments.\nWhat\u2019s more, you can time your visit to coincide with one of the numerous festivals, from jazz to sailing, gospel to rum, reggae to horse racing. Most of them are infused by the Bajans\u2019 fervent desire to party.\nWith the island being just 21 miles long, it\u2019s easy to dip in and out of all the attractions as the mood takes you for a holiday that can be as enriching, exhilarating or relaxing as you like.\nBarbados is so exotic yet also so familiar in many respects. Its enterprising people have nurtured a country in which Caribbean traditions are melded with the highest standards of comfort and cuisine afforded to visitors, though the leisurely rhythm of life remains a fine antidote to the frenetic lives many of us lead.\nThe familiarity comes through a strong British influence. Wander through the Unesco-listed old part of the vibrant capital, Bridgetown, and you\u2019ll notice a statue of Lord Nelson that pre-dates the one in London\u2019s Trafalgar Square. Some of the old churches are straight out of a rural UK parish. Over on the wild east coast, a rock bears a plaque informing passers-by that the road here was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1966. That\u2019s the year Barbados became independent, though Her Majesty remains the country\u2019s head of state.\nThe island was first settled by the British in 1627 and remained a colony until 1966. This legacy is evident in the many historic buildings, especially St Ann\u2019s Fort, built in 1705 and used by the British Armed Forces until 1905.\nToday, the African roots of the majority of the population are cherished and celebrated, although the systems of government and education remain firmly based on the British model (and let\u2019s not forget the islanders\u2019 passion for cricket). English is the official language, though you\u2019ll hear the locals effortlessly switch between this and their own impenetrable dialect.\nThere\u2019s another significant connection to our homeland \u2013 British Airways has been flying to Barbados since the 1950s and now operates up to 12 flights each week from London Gatwick.\nSo let\u2019s take a closer look inside the box of treats that Barbados offers. The weather can more or less be taken for granted. It\u2019s wonderful all year. When it does rain \u2013 and all that lush foliage needs regular watering \u2013 it\u2019s usually in short, refreshing doses.\nThe west coast is the Caribbean at its most sublime. Powder-sand beaches kissed by transparent turquoise waters are discreetly lined with first-class hotels, their gardens perfumed by stunning blooms. Quaint shops huddle in picturesque villages and superb golf courses are barely more than a tee-shot away.\nDown south, lively St Lawrence Gap is the epicentre of the island\u2019s entertainment. The dazzling beaches continue, this time washed by waves that are favoured by novice surfers and stand-up paddleboarders. A mix of luxurious all-inclusive hotels and good-value apartments create a welcoming community.\nBetween these two shores lies Bridgetown, the sweep of Carlisle Bay and a charming waterfront where you can board a catamaran for a day cruise, join a diving adventure or even take a ride in a submarine.\nOn the east coast and up in the north, it\u2019s a completely different picture, almost as if you had stepped on to another island. Breakers sweep the untouched beaches, some adorned by giant coral rocks.

These are great places to mingle with the Bajan people, which brings me to a less tangible yet powerfully evident quality that makes Barbados so special. Everywhere you go, be it on the beach, at the market or on the dance floor, you\u2019ll notice wide smiles and an eagerness to banter. The locals love their island, and there\u2019s little they like more than you loving it too."

By about 7 p.m. both chambers resigned themselves to failure and agreed to resume work on Sunday.\nBoth Republicans and Democrats had dug in during the day, each side blaming the other.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate would vote at 0100 EST (0600 GMT) Monday on a bill to fund the government through Feb. 8, unless Democrats agree to hold it sooner.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be right back at this tomorrow and for as long as it takes\u201d for Democrats to vote for legislation that would reopen the government, McConnell said.\nOutside the U.S. Capitol, parks, open-air monuments and Smithsonian museums were open as a second annual women\u2019s rights march took place on the National Mall. But visitors were turned away from the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia and the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island in New York Harbor.\nA scheduled trip by Trump and some Cabinet members to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, was being assessed on a day-to-day basis, White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said.\nRepublicans said they would refuse to negotiate on immigration until Democrats provide the votes to re-open the government. Democrats insisted they have been willing to compromise but Republicans backed out of deals.\n\u201cThe president will not negotiate on immigration reform until Democrats stop playing games and reopen the government,\u201d said White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders.\nMarc Short, the White House\u2019s legislative affairs director, said Trump had been in contact with Republican leaders in Congress during the day, but had not reached out to Democrats.\nShort said the president likely would be most effective making the case for ending the shutdown directly to the American people, and he did not rule out Trump addressing the nation in the coming days.\nThe tough message from the White House and Republicans in Congress led to speculation that Washington could be in for a prolonged political battle.\nAt the U.S. Capitol, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer delivered a stinging portrayal of Trump as an unreliable negotiating partner, saying the two sides came close to an agreement several times only to have Trump back out at the urging of anti-immigration conservatives.\nThe federal government had been running on three consecutive temporary funding bills since the new fiscal year began in October.\nDemocrats had sought to secure permanent legal protections for 700,000 young undocumented immigrants as a condition for new government funding after their attempts to push through the protections in stand-alone bills were rebuffed. Trump ordered the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival program to expire in March, requiring Congress to act.\nEarlier, McConnell said a solution to the crisis was \u201cjust inches away\u201d but he blamed Democrats for blocking legislation to pass the fourth stopgap funding measure.\nOne idea floated by Republicans was to renew government funding through Feb. 8 to end the shutdown, while working to resolve other issues, including immigration, military and non-military spending, disaster relief and some healthcare matters.\nU.S. Representative Gerry Connolly, a Democrat whose northern Virginia district has one of the highest concentrations of federal government employees, said there was no sign that serious bipartisan negotiations were taking place and he would be surprised if Congress reached a resolution before Monday.\nHe attributed the lack of talks to \u201craw feelings\u201d and that Trump had walked away on Friday from a deal on immigration.\nA video ad released on Saturday by Trump\u2019s presidential campaign that says Democrats will be \u201ccomplicit\u201d in murders by illegal immigrants could inflame tensions.\nTrump had portrayed himself as the ultimate dealmaker, but his inability to cut a deal despite having a Republican majority in both houses of Congress marked arguably the most debilitating setback for his administration.\n\u201cThis is the One Year Anniversary of my Presidency and the Democrats wanted to give me a nice present,\u201d he said on Twitter.\nThe immediate impact of the government shutdown was eased somewhat by it beginning on a weekend.\nThe Defense Department said combat operations in Afghanistan and other military activities would continue, while federal law enforcement officers also would remain on duty.\nTalks on the North American Free Trade Agreement will continue, as will major cybersecurity functions, and most of the Environmental Protection Agency will remain open, budget director Mulvaney said.\nBut without a quick deal, hundreds of thousands of government employees will be put on temporary unpaid leave."

        "output": "is geared to improve the industry's and the company's viability in the years ahead.\nDakins said the company has inventory from previous hunts on hand.\nHowever, he said they will be purchasing a limited amount of seal meat from harvesters who are participating.\nAs a result of the decision, Dakins said Carino has also decided not to access any of the $1 million loan announced last week by the provincial government.\n\"At this point we just want to focus our efforts on the sale of our existing inventory,\" Dakins told CBC's Fisheries Broadcast.\n\"It just falls into the basic concept of fiscal responsibility and the financial responsibility of our company to remain strong and be a significant player next year.\"\nDakins said the key to a viable operation for Carino and any operator in the business is to match supply and demand. That being the case, he said the company doesn't need the raw material at this particular point in time.\n\"Had we continued to just stockpile goods and not appropriately market and plan the flow of goods out the back end, that would be irresponsible. We're here, we've got lots of pelts, we've got lots of oil, we're going to procure the meat we require, and we'll be here stronger and better next year,\" Dakins said.\n\"It wasn't an easy decision, it wasn't one we take lightly, we know we have a responsibility to keep our harvesters viable. But it is short term pain for long term gain, that's how we view it.\"\nDakins said the hours for Carino processing workers will be affected due to the lack of raw material processing, but he the impact will be lessened by the fact the company's dressing and dyeing operations will be running as per usual.\nThe key going forward, he said, will be accessing international markets for seal products and demonstrating globally that the harvest is not only viable and sustainable, but also a necessary fisheries eco-management tool.\n\"I think that we're challenged with an appropriate model that's going to be received internationally to allow us to trade our products into a number of markets,\" he said.\n\"Without a viable seal hunt, what do we do in terms of managing this population? It's clear we can't afford expensive culls, and Canadians don't prescribe to wasting a resource; they prefer to see it harvested and utilized under the basic principles of sustainable use to improve our economy.\n\"If that is not realized sooner rather than later we will lose the capacity to go and hunt to a high animal welfare standard, and trade the products and be a contributor to our local economies.\"\nDakins said the idea Carino doesn't appreciate having another seal buyer in the fold is incorrect. On the contrary, he argues the emergence of new players means there must be something going right in the industry.\n\"Carino has spent enormous effort in developing international markets over the past 100-plus years, so it's nice to see new entrants because there must be something we've been doing that is encouraging and showing people there is a brighter future.\"\n\"There is more than enough resource to sustain more than one player in this industry. In 2008 there were five businesses, dressing facilities, that were operating 52 weeks a year on seal products. If one experiences a benefit then we'll all experience a benefit in this very difficult sector that has been challenged by misinformation for so long.\"\nDakins argues that misinformation continues to flow largely from anti-sealing lobbies. He argues the continued assertions by those groups that the harvest is unsustainable, inhumane and provides products that nobody wants is factually incorrect.\n\"They're part of the business, they make money off the concept that we are cruel, that we are barbaric and that we are doing something incorrect,\" Dakins said.\n\"In their case they just want to completely stop the whole thing. It's all hocus-pocus.\n\"This is a viable industry, self-sustaining and provides good products to customers.\"\nJamie Baker hosts The Broadcast each weekday on CBC Radio."

But with Pepperdine\u2019s limited living premises, having a pet-friendly campus just isn\u2019t a viable option.\nAnimals do not belong in the cramped dorm lifestyle. Most students have barely enough room for their own things in their small",
        "output": "two or three person rooms. Animals need space to run around. When a room is barely big enough to hold its human tenants, how can another living creature be expected to reside in there comfortably?\nAdditionally, living with roommates (as most Pepperdine students do) is already tricky as it is. Throwing pets into the mix will only make things more complicated. Just because an owner may love their pet and all its weird habits does not mean that everyone else will. One may forgive their dog for destroying their shoes, but when that dog destroys their roommate\u2019s things, it\u2019s another story.\nFurthermore, college life is not conducive to good pet care. Students are away for hours each day in class and other events where they cannot bring their pets. This means leaving them in cramped dorm rooms where they will be confined and lonely. Feeding and walking times may not always line up with a student\u2019s busy schedule. Hiring pet sitters is an expense few college students can afford, and leaving them in the care of friends or roommates quickly becomes a complicated enterprise.\n\u201cEveryone may be enthusiastic at first, but don\u2019t think that they\u2019re automatically agreeing to take care of the pet as if it were their own,\u201d wrote Megan Tackett in her article \u201c5 reasons college students and pets don\u2019t mix,\u201d published Oct. 6, 2015 by We Are IU.\nEven if roommates are comfortable with the pet, neighbors may not be. One dog howling in the night on a college campus could disturb the entire community. There are literally thousands of people living in close quarters at Pepperdine, all of whom have the potential to be affected by any pets on campus.\nMoreover, college students are not known for having a lot of money. They can barely keep themselves fed, much less a dog or cat, and veterinarian visits are notoriously expensive. But working a job means even less time to spend with one\u2019s pet.\nPets are a huge responsibility, and they take up a lot of time that a student might otherwise spend studying. Cats and dogs need a lot of attention, and they will do whatever it takes to get it, even if that means walking across one\u2019s keyboard or chewing on things they shouldn\u2019t. \u201cDogs need to be walked regardless of whether you have a term paper due,\u201d writes T. J. Banks in her article \u201cThe Pros and Cons of Having a Pet at College,\u201d published Oct. 2, 2017 by Petful.\nFor the unfocused student, pets are the perfect excuse to get out of work. Who wouldn\u2019t rather play with their pet than write an essay?\nAdditionally, there is the question of what happens after graduation. Most students are only at Pepperdine for a short amount of time, usually four years. Students who get a pet during this time will need to figure out what to do with it when they go to a new campus for grad school, or to new living quarters where the pet policy may not be as friendly. Roommates who get a pet together will have to decide who keeps it after graduation. Furthermore, Pepperdine has a unique situation in which most of its students go abroad at some point during their time here. 59 percent of this year\u2019s freshman class applied for an International Program, according to Arthur Puu\u2019s article \u201cInternational Program Growth Raises Questions for Studying Abroad Accommodations,\u201d published Nov. 7, 2017 by the Pepperdine Graphic. This means finding a home for their pets for a semester or a year while they are out of the country.\nAlthough the idea of a pet-friendly Pepperdine may seem like a dream come true for many animal lovers, the impractical logistics make it a nightmare in reality. Pets should not be allowed on Pepperdine\u2019s campus."

As the Federal army was approaching the town, Frazier helped set up Confederate pickets at the foot of Lookout Mountain. He was inside the Presbyterian church with his cousin, Beriah Frazier Moore, when a shell hit the top of the church on Aug. 21. Due to an injury, he stayed some weeks at the home of the Rev. T.H.

In 1871, he married Ann Elizabeth Keith, a granddaughter of Judge Charles Fleming Keith of Athens, Tenn. Her parents were Col. Alexander Hume Keith and Sarah Ann Foree Keith. S.J.A. Frazier decided to purchase a large tract at the old Cowart farm across the river from Chattanooga. The North Chattanooga hills were still mostly in timber at that time. In 1882, Frazier began to lay out the \"Hill City\" suburb. The Fraziers moved into the old Cowart home, \"The Cedars.\" The street that went in front of The Cedars was named Frazier Avenue.

Can anyone offer evidence that would enable a court to evaluate whether the use of race is narrowly tailored to achieve its purported goal? The black-box nature of admissions policies makes it impossible to ascertain whether race is a thumb or brick on the scale.\nAdmissions programs frustrate accountability because schools wield \u201cholistic review\u201d as a shield to frustrate scrutiny, judicial or otherwise. Holistic review can serve as a cover for the illegitimate use of race.\nFor example, Princeton professor Thomas Espenshade found that Asian students applying to selective private colleges are six times less likely to be admitted than Hispanic students with the same academic qualifications and 16 times less likely than black students. And despite being the fastest-growing population in America, Asians are admitted at Ivy League schools in remarkably similar numbers and percentages year-to-year.\nThose are the sorts of things that the Justice Department should look into. Government lawyers must open the \u201cholistic\u201d black box and hold administrators\u2019 feet to the constitutional fire. And that\u2019s before we even get into the harm to the beneficiaries of racial preferences!\nI have my policy disagreements with Attorney General Jeff Sessions over the drug war and related issues, but I applaud him here. When he was nominated, his supporters argued that he was a civil-rights advocate who had no truck with racial discrimination. Six months later, he\u2019s proving their point."

Here is the story of the ninth week.\nOur team likes to joke that you can",

We're proud of this unerring correlation when we look back, and humbly resigned to this truth when planning and packing out the next mini-journey in our adventure.\nTrue to form, our first day of backpacking on Eglin Air Force Base in the Florida Panhandle was rainy and wet, followed by cool and windy and then cold and windy. We did our best to defy the elements for a time, blocking the wind from the camp stove, starting a fire and feeding it, moving closer and closer to the hot coals until the desire to get in our sleeping bags overpowered the waning warmth of the fire.\nThe next morning was sunny and crisp. It's not every day that you get to hike or paddle your way through a military base, or so I'd thought. When we went to pick up our permit at Jackson Guard, we learned that much of the base is open to the public for various types of recreation via a permit system and a map of planned area closures that is updated each evening for the following days. Florida Trail folks and Eglin managers worked to route miles of the Florida National Scenic Trail along the northern periphery of the base, and to implement a registration system to allow through-hikers to camp at designated sites. Volunteers construct and maintain the trail here just like the rest of the trail, and we found it in excellent condition, with sturdy bridges and creek crossings, and elevated timbers to keep feet dry in the persistently wet locations. There were no signs of military training despite the warning of unexploded ordinances, and the rumbling noises in the distance were the only reminders that you're on an active base. This hiking on Eglin is varied, with plant communities and topography ranging from the top of sandhills and along steephead ravine edges down to innumerable sparkling, sandy-bottomed, clear water creek crossings.\nI'd been looking forward to Eglin for a long time, and it did not disappoint. The base and its partnerships are known in conservation circles for pioneering the use of prescribed fire, and for all aspects of longleaf pine ecosystem restoration. Longleaf has been reduced to less than 3 percent of its original range across the southeastern United States, and Eglin has some of the remaining and rare old growth. Eglin is also lauded for conservation successes with recovery of threatened and endangered species, such as the Okaloosa darter, a fish that lives almost entirely in six streams on the base. The 460,000-plus-acre size of the base is impressive and important for conservation. In addition to its core mission, the base is the keystone in the middle of a connected and protected landscape that spans more than a million acres from the Choctawhatchee River to Conecuh National Forest in Alabama. We hike on, anxious to be on time to meet Brig. Gen. David Harris, Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam, and adjacent private landowners MC and Stella Davis, to celebrate the different strands of fabric of land ownership that weave together to embody the Florida Wildlife Corridor."

John Allen, the senior American envoy for the coalition fighting Islamic State (IS), says it will take \u201ca generation or more\u201d to defeat the radical Muslim organization.\nOne may assume that what Allen means by such a",
        "output": "statement is that IS will be holding on to territory for a long period of time. Allen added that if IS were not defeated, it would wreak ever-greater havoc on the world order.\nIt seems bizarre that anybody would choose to make such long-term forecasts, the more so as earlier this year President Obama asked Congress to approve a three-year military campaign.\nBut Allen\u2019s remarks, whether realistic or not, can serve for more detailed reflection on what it would mean if, years from now, IS were to control territory of a substantial size.\nAs far as the Muslim world is concerned, the Arab Spring has already added Libya, Yemen, and Syria to the roster of failed countries. The continued existence of IS might lead to Iraq and possibly other countries being added to that list. IS, an extremist Sunni movement, is opposed to Shi\u2019ite Islam. The longer IS lasts, the greater the threat to the Shi\u2019ites.\nThis means that eventually IS would seek to directly confront Iran, the leading Shi\u2019ite country. Iran has been an international troublemaker and the more powerful IS becomes, the more it will feel the need to challenge the Iranians.\nAs IS also opposes the Sunni countries presently ruled by various royal families, the instability in these countries would increase substantially as well. The same is true concerning Egypt.\nFor the West, the threats would be of a varying nature. A prime concern is Europe\u2019s dependency on Arab countries for its oil supply. Instability in oil-producing countries such as Iraq and Libya has been dealt with so far without great trouble. Instability in Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern suppliers may have a much more disruptive effect.\nAnother potential repercussion for the West would be an increase in terrorism. In the previous century, terrorist acts perpetrated by Muslims in Europe were often carried out by non-Europeans \u2013 the attack on the Goldenberg restaurant in Paris in 1982, for example.\nIn recent years, however, Muslim terrorist attacks in Europe have often been carried out by EU residents. That was partly the case in the huge 2004 Madrid attack. It was certainly so in the 2005 London murders, the killing of French soldiers and Jews by Muhammad Merah in 2012, the murders at the Brussels Jewish Museum in 2014, and the killings in Paris and Copenhagen earlier this year.\nSo far, calls by IS leaders for Western Muslims to carry out terrorist acts in their countries of residence have not made much impact. There is a greater fear of terrorism from European jihadis returning from Syria and Iraq, but so far that has materialized only to a limited extent.\nThe tepid response to such calls for terrorism by Western Muslims may cause a shift back to terrorist attacks perpetrated by foreign jihadists.\nWhat would all this mean for Jews living abroad? Not much good. Attacks on others are often followed by attacks on Jews. This was true in the Merah, Charlie Hebdo, and Copenhagen killings.\nGiven these uncertainties, what can a small country such as Israel do? It must improve its intelligence structure and be very flexible in its policies. The threats are substantial. Israel may at some point find itself with IS or other terrorist organizations on all its borders.\nThere may, however, also be a number of opportunities, for Israel. No other country has accumulated as much experience in effectively fighting Muslim terrorists of various kinds. Israeli know-how in this field is already in demand and that is only likely to increase \u2013 a development that may boost Israel\u2019s popularity among Western populations.\nAnd some Arab states may come to see Israel as less of a threat than IS. A recent poll showed that Saudis feel Iran constitutes the greatest threat facing them, followed by IS. Israel ranked third.\nThe challenges and opportunities presented by the fight against IS will no doubt play a key role in Israel\u2019s strategic thinking \u2013 and quite possibly help improve its image in the Middle East and Europe.\nWait until they get their hands on an aircraft carrier.\ndo not expect any change any time soon, it takes 3 generations to secure the altering of identity, this mess of isis goes back to \u2026.\nSyrian James Abourezk (puppet master behind AIM) in support of the Baath Party (a faction of the PLO): PLO/SLA > Islamic Brotherhood > al qaeda, hezbollah, talmud , taliban > Hamas > re-branded to ISIS: \u2026.\nTo this day, through groups such as the Lakota Peoples Law Project (Abourezk and BJ Jones are advisers), Lastrealindians, and other so called 1st nations youth foster care advocate working group affiliates, the continuance of creating avenues to nurture children and the youth into hate machines resumes under the pretense of concern for traditional 1st nations values.\nThis is a conflict which will last until the Mashiah arrives.\nIran and ISIS both need to be defeated and you will be surprised how quite the region will get as well the overall terrorist attacks. I hope it will never happen again, but all indications point that if the US would get once again hit hard like 911, it will draw them into another major war as that will be the only way to Eliminate Iran and ISIS.\nWell,if left to Obama (or Hillary), it will never get done. Our military can do the job in less than six months.\nThey could be defeated in a month, if the merchants of the world and the kings they hold in their pockets saw any profit in it. Just stop buying anything from anywhere they are in control, and you will starve them out.\nThey sell oil, and not much else. Cut off their money supply, and destroy their weapons and vehicles, and they will not be able to buy any more. Then kill them off.\nIt is all so simple \u2014 It is oil alone, which has funded Islamic terrorism.\nIf you get the money-grubbers and their puppet rulers out of the mix, and keep attacking them in retaliation, it will all implode on its own.\nBack to the stone age for them."

        "output": "school playground in South Carolina.\nSix days before he allegedly opened fire on an elementary school playground, the eighth-grader returned to his Instagram group chat to fixate, yet again, on his most intense interests: guns and bombs and the mass murder of children.\n\"My plan,\" wrote Jesse Osborne, who had turned 14 three weeks earlier, \"is shooting my dad getting his keys getting in his truck, driving to the elementary school 4 mins away, once there gear up, shoot out the bottom school class room windows, enter the building, shoot the first class which will be the 2d grade, grab teachers keys so I don't have to hasle to get through any doors.\"\nHe had been researching other school shooters for months and, determined to outdo them, learned exactly how many people they'd murdered: 13 at Columbine High; 26 at Sandy Hook Elementary; 32 at Virginia Tech.\n\"I think ill probably most likely kill around 50 or 60,\" Jesse declared. \"If I get lucky maybe 150.\"\nOn Valentine's Day, at the same time police say another angry teen, Nikolas Cruz, slaughtered 17 people at a Parkland, Florida, high school with a semiautomatic AR-15, Jesse was sitting in a South Carolina courtroom, waiting to find out if he would be tried as an adult for a 2016 rampage that left his father and a 6-year-old dead.\nThe two teens have much in common. Both, investigators say, tortured animals, obsessed over guns and bragged of their deadly intentions on social media. And in the hours after Cruz's alleged killing spree, as the nation began, once again, to ask why, a group of detectives, prosecutors and psychiatrists were providing answers about Jesse, now 15. He'd detailed his motives in dozens of online messages, in his 46-page confession and in lengthy interviews with doctors who evaluated him, offering extraordinary insight into the mind of an American school shooter.\nFor Peter Langman, one of the country's leading experts on the subject, the teen's calculated approach and lack of empathy called to mind Eric Harris, one of the Columbine killers Jesse idolized.\n\"The coldbloodedness, the callousness of the attack - not only before but afterwards,\" said Langman, who was not involved in the case but has reviewed Jesse's confession. \"Even having done it, he's not struck with horror or guilt.\"\nIn fact, James Ballenger, a psychiatrist who interviewed Jesse for a total of nine hours, found that the teen reveled in what he'd done.\n\"He wants to talk about how dangerous he is,\" Ballenger testified. \"He wanted people to know.\"\nAt the five-day hearing that began Feb. 12, prosecutors pushed for Jesse to be tried as an adult because if he remained in the juvenile system, he could only be held until age 21. Jesse's defense team, meanwhile, tried to portray him as a lost but misunderstood child, alleging that he had been bullied by kids at school and mistreated by his father at home.\nJesse, who had grown up on his family's chicken farm, liked to shoot guns, but so did many boys his age in Townville, a rural community 40 miles southwest of Greenville. He camped with his grandparents, whom he adored, and watched the movie \"Frozen,\" one of his favorites. An avid reader of history, he told his family he wanted to fly to space when he grew up.\nAt odds with that portrait were Jesse's own words, captured in dozens of messages he'd exchanged in his private chat group, which the teen claimed included users from around the world.\n\"I HAVE TO BEAT ADAM LAZA . . .,\" he wrote nine days before the Sept. 28, 2016, shooting in a misspelled reference to the Sandy Hook killer, Adam Lanza. \"Atleast 40.\"\nTwo days later, he debated whether he should attack his middle school, from which he'd been expelled, or his elementary school, just up the road. He decided on Townville Elementary, because it was closer and had no armed security. Jesse, who considered himself the victim of an unfair world, announced online that he would kill kids he didn't know and had never met \"before they bullie the nobodys.\"\n\"Itll be like shooting fish in a barrel,\" he wrote his friends, whose identities remain unclear, along with whether the FBI has tracked any of them down. The agency declined to comment, citing Jesse's open case.\nIn the chat, he said he had researched police response times for the area and found that it would take them 15 minutes to get there, and maybe 45 for SWAT. He said he would throw pipe bombs into each classroom before he got in a shootout with police and killed himself with his shotgun. He said he had been planning a massacre for two years.\nA detective later discovered that Jesse, then a 6-foot-tall, 147-pound wispy-haired blond with a voice that tended to crack, had used his phone to Google these terms: \"deadliest US mass shootings,\" \"top 10 mass shooters,\" \"youngest mass murderer,\" \"10 youngest murderers in history.\"\nSeven hours after he was pinned to the ground outside Townville Elementary by a volunteer firefighter, Jesse acknowledged in an interview with investigators that he'd shot far fewer kids than he'd intended. The problem, he explained, was the weapon. He'd only had access to the .40 caliber pistol his father kept in a dresser drawer. It had jammed on the playground, just 12 seconds after he first pulled the trigger.\nThe weapon Jesse really wanted, the one he'd tried desperately to get, was, the teenager believed, locked in his father's gun safe: the Ruger Mini-14, a semiautomatic rifle much like the gun that, 17 months later, was fired again and again at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High, during one of the deadliest school shootings in American history.\nHis obsession began, he said, with a song that mentioned Columbine.\nJesse wanted to know what it meant, so he asked his father, who told him about the April 20, 1999, attack that became a seminal moment in the evolution of modern mass shootings.\n\"And so I researched more,\" he said during his confession. \"Then I looked up all these other ones.\"\nThrough much of his childhood, Jesse had seemed no different from any other kid in the Southern community of 4,000 people. Before he attacked Townville Elementary, Jesse had gone there through fifth grade, doing well in his classes and hardly ever getting into trouble. He played catcher on a rec-league baseball team. He got invited to birthday parties.\nIt wasn't until he moved to a middle school in a neighboring county that his \"other side,\" as one psychiatrist put it, became clear. He pulled the legs off crickets and smashed frogs against the ground and habitually watched a video of kittens being mutilated. He also posted Instagram videos about Columbine that some at the school considered a potential threat. The teen grew more volatile, insisting that he'd been bullied, a claim investigators later questioned.\nAfter one kid poked his chest, Jesse threatened him.\n\"When I come back with a rifle, you're going to be the one I shoot,\" he recalled to Ballenger, who noted in court that Jesse \"loved how much it scared the boy.\"\nThen, one day, he brought a hatchet and a machete in his backpack. When another student spotted the weapons and reported him, Jesse was expelled and arrested, serving a brief stint in juvenile detention before being placed on probation.\nIt was then, as a home-schooler, that he became consumed with violent fantasies, the court evidence showed. How much his parents knew about them remains unclear, but at least once, the couple came across Internet messages he'd written that they found disturbing, and his mother acknowledged to investigators that he'd become increasingly difficult to raise.\nJesse, whose older siblings had moved away, spent long stretches alone in his room, where he played first-person shooter games for hours and scoured the Internet for information on firearms. Beneath one YouTube video reviewing guns, The Washington Post found that he'd asked about the quality of a Hi-Point 9mm Carbine, an affordable semiautomatic rifle. In response to a question about gun licenses on another video, he wrote, \"depends on your state. here in south caralina we dont need a lisense for anything except explosives or machine guns which are crazy expensive.\" At least once, he commented on a video titled \"Active Shooter in the School - Plans and Drills.\"\nJesse told police that he had also discovered the \"true crime community\" on Tumblr, where fans of serial killers and mass murderers gather to delight in their shared devotion. Through that, his fascination with other school shooters, especially Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, bloomed. His Instagram username included \"nbk,\" for the movie \"Natural Born Killers,\" and \"kmfdm,\" for a German industrial band - a pair of pop-culture references that appeared frequently in the writings of the Columbine killers.\nThe pair's influence over the past two decades has been enormous, said Langman. He noted that Jesse was at least the 33rd gunmen to cite Harris and Klebold as an influence.\n\"Knowing about a school shooter doesn't cause someone to become a school shooter,\" Langman once wrote. \"For people already at risk or on a path toward violence, however, external influences in the form of other mass attacks may be a factor in spurring them on toward committing their own attack.\"\nThat was clearly true for Jesse, who mentioned Lanza and Harris in his messages and Seung-Hui Cho, the Virginia Tech gunman, in his confession.\nOn the morning of the shooting, he preloaded a magazine for his dad's handgun, writing to his chat group that he would soon \"be on the news.\" When his dad, who Jesse accused with little evidence of being an abusive drunk, \"started fussing\" at the boy, he retrieved the pistol, came down stairs and shot his father in the back of the head.\nHe said goodbye to his dogs and gave his favorite rabbit, Floppy, a kiss, he told investigators, before putting on a vest, packed with more than a dozen extra rounds, and heading to the school, where he arrived at 1:41 p.m.\n\"The first shot I hit someone. Second I hit a window,\" he told his interrogators.\n\"The first shot you hit someone?\" one of them asked.\n\"I think. I just seen red pop up, so I just assumed.\"\nAnd had his gun not jammed, they asked him, what would have happened?\n\"Now I have a life,\" Jesse announced near the end of his confession. \"Probably won't get a job, but I'll - I'll at least have a life.\"\nThat sounded bizarre for a teenager who knew he would likely face decades in prison, but, as the experts who would analyze him soon discovered, the comment spoke to Jesse's chief motivation.\nBallenger, a psychiatrist with 40 years of experience, had already analyzed Dylann Roof, the white supremacist who killed nine African-Americans in a Charleston church in 2015, and Jared Lee Loughner, who killed six people and wounded Democratic Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in Arizona in 2011. What he saw in Jesse was a young man who killed not because of bullies or abuse or a fractured mind, but because he wanted to attain the life and status he'd envisioned.\n\"He was going to be famous, the best shooter ever,\" Ballenger testified. \"He was going to be worshiped for a long time - worshiped.\"\n\"Did you see evidence of him looking at statistics of people to see how he lines up?\" a prosecutor asked him.\nBallenger noted Jesse's Google searches for other mass shootings before his attack.\n\"He actually confirmed that he would be one of the youngest, if not the youngest,\" the doctor said.\n\"And that was one of his goals?\"\n\"That was his goal,\" Ballenger told the court. \"To be the best shooter - to get 50 to 60.\"\nBut Jesse didn't kill that many, not even close, and in a country that barely notices school shootings in which just a single child dies, his brief assault garnered only momentary attention outside South Carolina.\nFor Townville, though, those 12 seconds of gunfire were devastating, leaving children, parents and teachers overcome with guilt and post-traumatic stress, as detailed in a Post story last year.\nA teacher and a student survived their bullet wounds, but one round Jesse is accused of firing took the life of Jacob Hall, a bespectacled 6-year-old who was the smallest child in first grade. Hundreds attended his funeral, where his body laid inside a miniature gray casket topped with a Ninja Turtles figurine. He was dressed in a Batman costume.\nJesse showed almost no remorse, according to experts who analyzed him. He mocked his victims and once suggested that he'd done Jacob \"a favor.\"\nIn court, prosecutors presented evidence that Jesse's preoccupation with violence never receded. After a 15-year-old killed two students and injured at least a dozen other people at a Kentucky school on Jan. 23, Jesse looked up the incident on a computer at the detention center. He also repeatedly searched for the lyrics of a vicious rap song, \"One Shot Kill.\"\n\"My observations of him in this courtroom over the last few days have been that he is still a hundred percent in that mind-set,\" Ballenger testified, saying that he'd seen Jesse smile, over and over, as his crimes were discussed. \"He's very comfortable in this hearing.\"\nThat's apparently not what Jesse had wanted to convey, though. After his arrest, he'd researched the symptoms of autism and schizophrenia, and in interviews with doctors, he talked of hallucinations that included seeing blue people and the cartoon character Scooby-Doo. His evaluators testified that, without question, he was lying.\nBallenger concluded that Jesse was at high risk for developing antisocial personality disorder, often called sociopathy, which cannot be diagnosed before age 18. He recommended that the teen be tried as an adult, and the judge agreed when he issued his Feb. 16 ruling.\nNever far from the courtroom discussion was the horror of what might have happened if the pistol he'd taken from his father's dresser drawer hadn't jammed or, even worse, he had used the semiautomatic rifle. Once, Jesse had pretended that he was texting on his phone as he tried to film his father typing in the code to the gun safe. Another time, he'd put dish soap on the buttons, hoping it would reveal fingerprints.\nJesse could have killed so many more children, he knew, with that Mini-14.\n\"To the media, it's called an assault rifle,\" he told interrogators before lamenting, for a second time, that it remained locked away.\nSoon after the shooting, investigators searched the teen's home for evidence. In his parents' bedroom, they looked in the closet, and there, outside the safe and just feet from his father's dresser, was the weapon Jesse coveted."

        "output": "how has your job changed over the years?\nWhen I first came to work in Jan. 1978, four rangers shared a single rotary dial telephone that swiveled between us on an accordion arm. Drafting a disposition form was a rare treat, accomplished by only the most senior staff. Fax machines came along enabling electronic queries with the reasonable expectation of same day responses.\nWhat can I say about modern improvements? You never get away from the job unless a server or cell tower goes down. If you lose internet connectivity, you\u2019re out of business. Field staffs have exceptional mapping tools at their disposal with a click of a button. Early in my career, we relied on Real Estate Segment maps and quad sheets. They don\u2019t begin to compare to the mapping technology we have today. ArcView technology resolves lots of complaints and misunderstandings with a simple aerial map highlighting ownership and encroachments.\nMiles Johnson is honored by the American Recreation Coalition as a Legends Award Winner in 2009 during Great Outdoors Week for his lifelong dedication to public service and improving recreational facilities for the public.\nWhat positions have you held in the district?\nMy responsibilities have primarily been in recreation and resource management as a ranger, park manager and now as resource manager. As a Natural Resource Management guy, I\u2019ve had the unusual opportunity to serve Russellville as Chief Navigation Maintenance on two occasions totaling eight months; worked in the Ozark Power House for five months; served as acting Russellville Operations Project Manager for more than two years; served as the team leader following 9/11 on the Risk Assessment for Dams where SWL assembled an interdisciplinary engineering team to evaluate the security risks/remediation for every SWL facility. My final detail was to Pine Bluff as acting site manager. It was one of the most enjoyable jobs of my career due to the friendly, outgoing, supportive staff. I genuinely enjoyed every day on the job.\nWhat was your favorite job position and why?\nI think the GS-11 Park Manager was the most enjoyable because it involved working with people every day to accomplish things that were desired by the public. It required teamwork which led to seeing plans come to fruition and working with the public ultimately effecting positive change.\nWhat are your plans in retirement?\nMy wife\u2019s goal is to make our home a \u201cgrandkid magnet\u201d. Her role is inspiration, mine perspiration. She\u2019s done very well so far, but I\u2019ve got numerous half-finished jobs that bug me and I don\u2019t like unfinished business and unfortunately her inspiration outpaces me. I plan to step-up my involvement in the Gideon Ministry, as well as continue working as a youth leader in my church. I hope to join friends in the Nail Benders, a Christian men\u2019s group who support churches with voluntary construction and labor services. I also plan to travel to the western states spending adequate time to \u201csee\u201d the country. I\u2019ve purchased National Park Service Passport Books for my grandchildren hoping to help them build memories of our travels that they might treasure as they grow. Finally, in my spare time I\u2019ve got a 1979 Jeep CJ5 and a yard that needs lots of attention. I\u2019ve got to figure some way to block HGTV to avoid resource drains on my plans.\nWhat will you miss the most about working with the Corps of Engineers?\nI\u2019ve thought about this a lot. I\u2019ll miss the people, co-workers and the public alike. I\u2019m convinced the truly important investments we make are not in things or accomplishments, but rather in the people we are privileged to work with and serve.\nWhat do you do to instill your veteran knowledge in new rangers?\nI consider myself a mentor and I try to get folks to look beyond the moment and imagine the promise of the future with the realization that people are most important, things much less so. I try to get them to understand that their goals will change. And while they may be satisfied with current circumstances, they need to prepare for the future. Interests and life situations change, as do we.\nWhat was the best part about your job?\nThe best part of my job involves working with people and seeing things accomplished. The way I get to know folks is by seeing a difficult task through as a team.\nI recall Bona Dea Trails and the promise it showed following its construction in 1980. The trail was a result of Joel Callaway and Dale Lassiter\u2019s collaboration to support community interest. Upon completion it was a barren construction site, portions of which locals referred to as the Desert, due to lack of shade. Our vision was a closed canopy covering the trail from shoulder to shoulder affording shade for all users. That vision for the park has come to fruition. On any given day, you\u2019ll see joggers, walkers, babies in strollers, children on bikes with training wheels and adults on mountain bikes all enjoying complete shade of a closed canopy trail.\nWhat has been your favorite project you have worked on?\nI really enjoyed my work on construction projects in Iraq. Work began with about 60 folks working daily, and by the time the projects were complete we ended up with 2,000 workers showing up daily. Again, the importance was the people, whom I engaged daily.\nMiles Johnson reads the citation for a water safety Life Saver award.\nWhat ways have your found to balance your home life with the busy schedule you have at work?\nI have a tremendously supportive wife! She has supported deployments, details, developmental assignments and calls at odd hours throughout my career without complaint, all the while holding down the home front and managing her own developing career. I have chosen to stay local to support my wife\u2019s career and determined to provide a stable home for my three sons. I sought a deployment to Iraq to demonstrate our individual responsibility to my sons. I had them join me while I was at USACE Headquarters on a five month detail so they could experience our Nation\u2019s Capital. I had my wife and younger sons join me in Louisiana at the Emergency Field Office where I worked as a Debris Resident Engineer to celebrate Thanksgiving during the Rita/Katrina Recovery to expose them to the hardships endured by others as well as our agency\u2019s support.\nIs there anything you would like to say to the other district employees?\nTake time to be kind, intentionally. Take time to do something intentionally to lift another\u2019s spirits. Listen\u2013 We live by deadlines, suspense\u2019s, spreadsheets, budgets, and meetings, and we need to take time out to listen and look. Notice your co-workers. It sounds corny, but I think it\u2019s important to take time for people and really communicate. We engage in business communication all the time, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re very good at effective communication."

Will the new capabilities we invested so much time and resources in actually function and",
        "output": "perform and expected, or will they draw the ire of customer? Getting answers to these questions is the last \u201cHoly Grail\u201d of IT. Unfortunately, most IT stakeholders focus on the number of tests that are successfully run, not whether the tests are providing insight into critical business risks.\nIt is a rare enterprise CIO who likes to dive into software testing methodologies. But, IT leaders at all levels might be intrigued to learn what an archaic and ineffective process most enterprises are using to test the innovations driving their digital transformation initiatives. The way it\u2019s commonly done, testing is an expensive activity that holds back your innovation\u2014without providing clear insight into the business risks of your applications.\nAs an industry veteran with experience across a broad swath of industries, I can tell you that transforming testing is emerging as a stealth strategy to take your digital transformation initiatives to the next level. Many organisations are quietly transforming their testing process to deliver instant insight into the business risks of each release candidate. At the same time, they\u2019re slashing testing costs, which frees up additional resources to dedicate to innovation. With this new competitive edge, they\u2019re surging ahead.\nWhat might surprise IT leaders\u2014and especially CIOs\u2014is that amount of time and money that testing requires vs. the business value that it actually delivers.\nMost testing focuses on the number of tests that are run, not whether the tests are addressing the risks that are most important to the business. Often the last stage of testing is conducted by a dedicated independent testing organisation with inadequate understanding of their company\u2019s business risks or objectives with the new software system. To make matters a bit worse, defects (or even false positives) discovered late are triaged for impact, and perhaps not addressed because of mounting pressure to release. And load testing \u2013 streaming transactions and queries against a system to make sure the system can handle full production volumes \u2013 usually gets short thrift.\nI understand that many IT leaders find software testing boring. However, upon learning that this process often consumes 40 per cent of an IT application budget, people tend to find it more intriguing.\nWhy is testing so ineffective yet expensive? Thanks to agile methodologies and DevOps, software development cycle times have been reduced significantly, yet today\u2019s software testing continues to operate at a slower pace\u2014creating a process cadence mismatch. This is because testing is dominated by manual tests. In fact, 70-80 per cent of software testing is manual, tedious, and time-intensive. At the end of the day, we do not really know whether the right tests were done, nor do we know if the software system and databases can perform well in production.\nSo, should a CIO care about software testing? Yes \u2013 but not about how many tests were completed. What is far more important is whether the tests that were completed actually address the business risks of the enterprise in a way that gives confidence in test results.\nRisk-based test automation provides a fast and cost-efficient way to control top business risks in software releases. This can\u2019t be reliably achieved by simply throwing more people or more tools at the problem. It requires a deliberately architected approach to continuous risk-based testing of what is important to you and your customers.\nRisk-based testing involves knowing that the organisation designed what the user needed, that what was designed was built to handle the risks of the business and perform to the requirements of the business, and what was released can handle the scaling of volume loads once in production.\nThe success of a business\u2019s innovative ideas depends on how quickly your team can develop and deploy those ideas in software. Any hiccup that slows down the process could hinder the success of your project. There's a delicate balance between moving fast enough to be first to market and moving cautiously enough to ensure that you won\u2019t crash and burn.\nIt\u2019s never going to be feasible to find and fix every issue with the application system before each release. But risk-based testing, which balances speed with quality, tells us whether we each detected issue is a small glitch that can be fixed later or a true showstopper.\nManual testing can rapidly become a roadblock to speeding new release candidates to market. But that\u2019s just the beginning. Manual testing, even with scores of testers often employed for even a single application, becomes exceedingly costly because it takes time and knowledge to know whether the critical risks to the business are being validated. The lost revenue and profitability in getting to market late can often dwarf testing costs, or allow a more nimble competitor to seize market advantage. If the cadence of software testing doesn\u2019t match development, there\u2019s an issue.\nThe adoption of risk-based test automation is rapidly becoming a priority for companies in the early stages of the development process, for the simple reason of keeping up with market demand. Enterprises must be up for the challenge of handling frequent changes to their system landscape and able to conduct end-to-end testing across all enterprise systems and remain stable in the production environment.\nNow that software is now the primary interface to the business, a software failure is a business failure and brand reputation risk. Automated risk-based testing is key to reducing the overall amount of testing while achieving the highest possible risk coverage. It\u2019s exactly what fast-moving DevOps teams need in order to immediately assess whether their changes have impacted the overall user experience. In addition, knowing that the new release can satisfy core functionality expectations, perform acceptably under the expected volume of transactions, and handle surges in volume is key for building confidence at the CXO level.\nTesting might not be exciting as the innovation process, which involves brainstorming ideas, watching them come to life as prototypes, and witnessing the process of bringing prototype to final production-ready software. Nevertheless, transforming testing is an often-overlooked, yet powerful, catalyst for innovation. With a modern approach driven by risk-based test automation, your organisation can free additional IT resources for innovation, bring your innovations to market faster, and ensure that they have a positive impact on the customer experience."

The anticipation of massive storm forced the closing of twenty-one voter registrar offices offering early absentee voting in ten counties in Virginia, including Arlington County, Fairfax County, Virginia Beach City and Suffolk Counties\u2014four of the most highly populated areas of the state. As the storm subsided and its most disastrous effects circumnavigated a majority of the state, Governor Bob McDonnell authorized, not mandated, local registrar offices to extend in-person absentee voting hours for the remainder of the week until the November 3 deadline.\nIn 2008, absentee votes accounted for 13 percent of all ballots cast in Virginia. Of these absentee votes, then nominee Barack Obama won 63 percent, making his margin of victory 6.3 percent. According to Daily Kos, the Virginia legislature initially reported that the margin of victory was only 3.4 percent, because it did not include absentee ballots. However, the Virginia Public Access Project indicates that absentee voting is down by 30 percent.\nThe state doesn\u2019t make it easy to vote early. Unlike other states, Virginia demands that early voters meet one of more than a dozen qualifications and sign a sworn statement. What does this mean for a president who won a state in 2008 on a winning margin provided by absentee ballots?

Georgia law requires that absentee ballots be mailed within two days of receipt of the application. Butler says that the applications in question were sent September 25, 2012, and she advised that the Elections Department is working with her to ensure that the affected applicants for absentee ballots will be processed in time for Election Day. Fulton County has continued to deny a backlog of voter registration applications.\nBut that\u2019s not all.

To combat the inertia, the ACLU has teamed up with the Service Employees International Union to mail out 90,000 letters clarifying for voters that they don\u2019t need ID.

        "input": "Jure Robic, the Slovene soldier who might be the worldA\u0302\u0092s best ultra-endurance athlete, lives in a small fifth-floor apartment near the railroad tracks in the town of Koroska Bela. By nature and vocation, Robic is a sober-minded person, but when he appears at his doorway, he is smiling. Not a",
        "output": "standard-issue smile, but a wild and fidgety grin, as if he were trying to contain some huge and mysterious secret.\nRobic catches himself, strides inside and proceeds to lead a swift tour of his spare, well-kept apartment. Here is his kitchen. Here is his bike. Here are his wife, Petra, and year-old son, Nal. Here, on the coffee table, are whiskey, JA\u0303\u00a4germeister, bread, chocolate, prosciutto and an inky, vegetable-based soft drink he calls Communist Coca-Cola, left over from the old days. And here, outside the window, veiled by the nightly ice fog, stand the Alps and the Austrian border. Robic shows everything, then settles onto the couch. ItA\u0302\u0092s only then that the smile reappears, more nervous this time, as he pulls out a DVD and prepares to reveal the unique talent that sets him apart from the rest of the world: his insanity.\nTonight, RobicA\u0302\u0092s insanity exists only in digitally recorded form, but the rest of the time it swirls moodily around him, his personal batch of ice fog. Citizens of Slovenia, a tiny, sports-happy country that was part of the former Yugoslavia until 1991, might glow with beatific pride at the success of their ski jumpers and handballers, but they tend to become a touch unsettled when discussing Robic, who for the past two years has dominated ultracyclingA\u0302\u0092s hardest, longest races. They are proud of their man, certainly, and the way he can ride thousands of miles with barely a rest. But theyA\u0302\u0092re also a little, well, concerned. Friends and colleagues tend to sidle together out of RobicA\u0302\u0092s earshot and whisper in urgent, hospital-corridor tones.\nPetek glances carefully at Robic, standing a few yards off. A\u0302\u0091A\u0302\u0091We lock the doors,A\u0302\u0092A\u0302\u0092 he whispers.\nWhen he overhears, Robic heartily dismisses their unease. A\u0302\u0091A\u0302\u0091They are joking!A\u0302\u0092A\u0302\u0092 he shouts. A\u0302\u0091A\u0302\u0091Joking!A\u0302\u0092A\u0302\u0092 But in quieter moments, he acknowledges their concern, even empathizes with it A\u0302\u0097 though heA\u0302\u0092s quick to assert that nothing can be done to fix the problem. Robic seems to regard his racetime bouts with mental instability as one might regard a beloved but unruly pet: awkward and embarrassing at times, but impossible to live without.\nThe craziness is methodical, however, and Robic and his crew know its pattern by heart. Around Day 2 of a typical weeklong race, his speech goes staccato. By Day 3, he is belligerent and sometimes paranoid. His short-term memory vanishes, and he weeps uncontrollably. The last days are marked by hallucinations: bears, wolves and aliens prowl the roadside; asphalt cracks rearrange themselves into coded messages. Occasionally, Robic leaps from his bike to square off with shadowy figures that turn out to be mailboxes. In a 2004 race, he turned to see himself pursued by a howling band of black-bearded men on horseback.\nThe DVD spins, and the room vibrates with Wagner. We see a series of surreal images that combine violence with eerie placidity, like a Kubrick film. RobicA\u0302\u0092s spotlit figure rides through the dark in the driving rain. Robic gasps some unheard plea to a stone-faced man in fatigues whoA\u0302\u0092s identified as his crew chief. Robic curls fetuslike on the pavement of a Pyrenean mountain road, having fallen asleep and simply tipped off his bike. Robic stalks the crossroads of a nameless French village at midnight, flailing his arms, screaming at his support crew. A baffled gendarme hurries to the scene, asking, Quel est le problA\u0303 \u0308me? I glance at Robic, and heA\u0302\u0092s staring at the screen, too.\nAnd going. In addition to races, Robic trains 335 days each year, logging some 28,000 miles, or roughly one trip around the planet.\nYet Robic does not excel on physical talent alone. He is not always the fastest competitor (he often makes up ground by sleeping 90 minutes or less a day), nor does he possess any towering physiological gift. On rare occasions when he permits himself to be tested in a laboratory, his ability to produce power and transport oxygen ranks on a par with those of many other ultra-endurance athletes. He wins for the most fundamental of reasons: he refuses to stop.\nIn a consideration of Robic, three facts are clear: he is nearly indefatigable, he is occasionally nuts, and the first two facts are somehow connected. The question is, How? Does he lose sanity because he pushes himself too far, or does he push himself too far because he loses sanity? Robic is the latest and perhaps most intriguing embodiment of the old questions: What happens when the human body is pushed to the limits of its endurance? Where does the breaking point lie? And what happens when you cross the line?\nThe Insight Race Across America was not designed by overcurious physiologists, but it might as well have been. ItA\u0302\u0092s the worldA\u0302\u0092s longest human-powered race, a coast-to-coast haul from San Diego to Atlantic City. Typically, two dozen or so riders compete in the solo categories.\nWinners average more than 13 miles an hour and finish in nine days, riding about 350 miles a day. The ones to watch, though, are not the victors but the 50 percent who do not finish, and whose breakdowns, like a scattering of so many piston rods and hubcaps, provide a vivid map of the human bodyA\u0302\u0092s built-in limitations.\nThe final collapse takes place between the ears. Competitors endure fatigue-induced rounds of hallucinations and mood shifts. Margins for error in the race can be slim, a point underlined by two fatal accidents at RAAM in the past three years, both involving automobiles. Support crews, which ride along in follow cars or campers, do what they can to help. For Robic, his support crew serves as a second brain, consisting of a well-drilled cadre of a half-dozen fellow Slovene soldiers. It resembles other crews in that it feeds, hydrates, guides and motivates A\u0302\u0097 but with an important distinction. The second brain, not RobicA\u0302\u0092s, is in charge.\nHis system is straightforward. During the race, RobicA\u0302\u0092s brain is allowed control over choice of music (usually a mix of traditional Slovene marches and Lenny Kravitz), food selection and bathroom breaks. The second brain dictates everything else, including rest times, meal times, food amounts and even average speed. Unless Robic asks, he is not informed of the remaining mileage or even how many days are left in the race.\nStanovnik is adept at motivating Robic along the way. When the mujahedeen appeared in 2004, Stanovnik pretended to see them too, and urged Robic to ride faster. When an addled Robic believes himself to be back in Slovenia, Stanovnik informs him that his hometown is just a few miles ahead. He also employs more time-honored, drill-sergeant techniques.\nIn all decisions, Stanovnik governs according to a rule of thumb that he has developed over the years: at the dark moment when Robic feels utterly exhausted, when he is so empty and sleep-deprived that he feels as if he might literally die on the bike, he actually has 50 percent more energy to give.\nIn this dual-brain system, RobicA\u0302\u0092s mental breakdowns are not an unwanted side effect, but rather an integral part of the process: welcome proof that the other limiting factors have been eliminated and that maximum stress has been placed firmly on the final link, RobicA\u0302\u0092s mind. While his long-term memory appears unaffected (he can recall route landmarks from year to year), his short-term memory evaporates. Robic will repeat the same question 10 times in five minutes. His mind exists completely in the present.\nInterestingly A\u0302\u0097 or unnervingly, depending on how you look at it A\u0302\u0097 some researchers are uncovering evidence that StanovnikA\u0302\u0092s rule of thumb might be right. A spate of recent studies has contributed to growing support for the notion that the origins and controls of fatigue lie partly, if not mostly, within the brain and the central nervous system. The new research puts fresh weight to the hoary coaching clichA\u0303\u00a9: you only think youA\u0302\u0092re tired.\nQuestions about the muscle-centered model came up again in 1989 when Canadian researchers published the results of an experiment called Operation Everest II, in which athletes did heavy exercise in altitude chambers. The athletes reached exhaustion despite the fact that their lactic-acid concentrations remained comfortably low. Fatigue, it seemed, might be caused by something else.\nIn 1999, three physiologists from the University of Cape Town Medical School in South Africa took the next step. They worked a group of cyclists to exhaustion during a 62-mile laboratory ride and measured, via electrodes, the percentage of leg muscles they were using at the fatigue limit. If standard theories were true, they reasoned, the body should recruit more muscle fibers as it approached exhaustion A\u0302\u0097 a natural compensation for tired, weakening muscles.\nInstead, the researchers observed the opposite result. As the riders approached complete fatigue, the percentage of active muscle fibers decreased, until they were using only about 30 percent. Even as the athletes felt they were giving their all, the reality was that more of their muscles were at rest. Was the brain purposely holding back the body?\nFrom this, Noakes and his colleagues concluded that A.V. Hill had been right about the automatic brake, but wrong about its location. They postulated the existence of what they called a central governor: a neural system that monitors carbohydrate stores, the levels of glucose and oxygen in the blood, the rates of heat gain and loss, and work rates. The governorA\u0302\u0092s job is to hold our bodies safely back from the brink of collapse by creating painful sensations that we interpret as unendurable muscle fatigue.\nThe governor theory is far from conclusive, but some scientists are focusing on a walnut-size area in the front portion of the brain called the anterior cingulate cortex. This has been linked to a host of core functions, including handling pain, creating emotion and playing a key role in whatA\u0302\u0092s known loosely as willpower. Sir Francis Crick, the co-discoverer of DNA, thought the anterior cingulate cortex to be the seat of the soul. In the sports world, perhaps no soul relies on it more than Jure RobicA\u0302\u0092s.\nNoakes and his colleagues speculate that the central governor theory holds the potential to explain not just feats of stamina but also their opposite: chronic fatigue syndrome (a malfunctioning, overactive governor, in this view). Moreover, the governor theory makes evolutionary sense. Animals whose brains safeguarded an emergency stash of physical reserves might well have survived at a higher rate than animals that could drain their fuel tanks at will.\nThe theory would also seem to explain a sports landscape in which ultra-endurance events have gone from being considered medically hazardous to something perilously close to routine. The Ironman triathlon in Hawaii A\u0302\u0097 a 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike ride and marathon-length run A\u0302\u0097 was the ne plus ultra in endurance in the 1980A\u0302\u0092s, but has now been topped by the Ultraman, which is more than twice as long. Once obscure, the genre known as adventure racing, which includes 500-plus-mile wilderness races like Primal Quest, has grown to more than 400 events each year. Ultramarathoners, defined as those who participate in running events exceeding the official marathon distance of 26.2 miles, now number some 15,000 in the United States alone. The underlying physics have not changed, but rather our sense of possibility. Athletic culture, like Robic, has discovered a way to tweak its collective governor.\nWhen we try understanding RobicA\u0302\u0092s relationship to severe pain, however, our interest tends to be more visceral. Namely, how does it feel?\nItA\u0302\u0092s a gray morning in December, and Robic is driving his silver Peugeot to one of his favorite training rides in the hills along SloveniaA\u0302\u0092s Adriatic coast. The wind is blowing 50 miles an hour, and the temperature is in the 40A\u0302\u0092s. If RobicA\u0302\u0092s anterior cingulate cortex can sometimes block out negative information, this is definitely not one of those times.\nRobic often complains like this. Even when the weather is ideal, he points out the clouds blowing in and how horrible and lonely his workout will be. At first it seems like showboat kvetching that will diminish as he gets more familiar with you, but as time wears on itA\u0302\u0092s apparent that his complaints are sincere. He isnA\u0302\u0092t just acting miserable A\u0302\u0097 he is miserable.\nThe negativity is accentuated, perhaps, by the fact that Robic trains exclusively alone. WhatA\u0302\u0092s more, heA\u0302\u0092s famously disinclined to seek advice when it comes to training, medical treatment and nutrition. A\u0302\u0091A\u0302\u0091Completely uncoachable,A\u0302\u0092A\u0302\u0092 says his friend Uros Velepec, a two-time winner of the Ultraman World Championships. Robic invents eclectic workout schedules: six hours of biking one day, seven hours of Nordic skiing the next, with perhaps a mountain climb or two in between, all faithfully tracked and recorded in a series of battered notebooks.\nRobic goes on to detail his motivational fuel sources, including his neglectful father, persistent near poverty (three years ago, he was reduced to asking for food from a farmer friend) and a lack of large-sponsor support because of SloveniaA\u0302\u0092s small size. (A\u0302\u0091A\u0302\u0091If I lived in Austria, I would be millionaire,A\u0302\u0092A\u0302\u0092 he says unconvincingly.) There is also a psychological twist of biblical flavor: a half brother born out of wedlock named Marko, JureA\u0302\u0092s age to the month. Robic says his father favored Marko to the extent that the old man made him part owner of his restaurant, leaving Jure, at age 28, to beg them for a dishwashing job.\nAs a young man, Robic was known as a village racer, decent enough locally but not talented enough to land a professional contract. Throughout his 20A\u0302\u0092s, he rode with small Slovene teams, supporting himself with a sales job for a bike-parts dealer. It was with the death of his mother in 1997 and his subsequent depression that Robic discovered his calling. On the advice of a cyclist friend, he started training for the 1999 Crocodile Trophy, a notoriously painful week-and-a-half-long mountain bike race across Australia. Robic finished third.\nIn October of 2001, Robic set out to see how far he could cycle in 24 hours. The day was unpromising: raw and wet. He nearly didnA\u0302\u0092t ride. But he did A\u0302\u0097 and went an estimated 498 miles, almost a world record.\nA year later, he quit his job and volunteered to join the Slovene military, undergoing nine months of intensive combat training (he surprised his unit with his penchant for late-night training runs). He earned a coveted spot in the sports division, which exists solely to support the nationA\u0302\u0092s top athletes. For Robic, the post meant a salary of 700 euros (about $850) a month and the freedom to train full time.\nThis day, despite the foul conditions, Robic trains for five and a half hours. He rides through toylike stone villages and fields of olive trees; he climbs mountains from whose peaks he can see the blue Adriatic and the coast of Italy. He rides across the border checkpoint into Croatia, along a deserted beach and past groves of fanlike bamboo. He rides in a powerful crouch, his big legs churning, his face impassive.\nWhile I watch from the car, IA\u0302\u0092m reminded of a scene the previous night. Robic and his support crew of fellow soldiers met at a small restaurant for a RAAM reunion. For several hours, they ate veal, drank wine out of small glass pitchers and reminisced in high spirits about the race. They spoke of the time Robic became unshakably convinced his team was making fun of him, and the time he sat on a curb in Athens, Ohio, and refused to budge for an hour, and the time they had to lift his sleeping body back onto his bike.\nRobic sat quietly in their midst, his eyes darting and quick. Sometimes heA\u0302\u0092d offer a word or a joke, but mostly he listened. At first it seemed he was being shy, but after a while it became apparent that he was curious to hear the stories. The person of whom they spoke A\u0302\u0097 this sometimes frightening, sometimes inspiring man named Jure Robic A\u0302\u0097 remained a stranger to him.\nRobic finishes his ride as the winter sun is going down. As we drive back toward Koroska Bela, a lens of white fog descends on the roadway. We pass ghostlike farms, factories and church spires while Robic talks about his plans for the coming year. He talks about his wife, whose job has supported them, and he talks about their son, who is starting to walk. He talks about how he will try to win a record third consecutive RAAM in June, and how he hopes race officials wonA\u0302\u0092t react to the recent fatalities by adding mandatory rest stops. (A\u0302\u0091A\u0302\u0091Then it will not be a true race,A\u0302\u0092A\u0302\u0092 he says.) In a few months, heA\u0302\u0092ll do his signature 48-hour training, in which he rides for 24 hours straight, stays awake all night, and then does a 12-hour workout.\nBut this year is going to be different in one respect. Robic is going to start working with a local sports psychologist who has previously helped several Slovene Olympians. It seems that Robic, the uncoachable one, is looking for guidance.\nRobic attempts to convey the intensity of his feeling, but can only gesture dramatically with his hands, which unfortunately are needed to control the steering wheel. The car veers toward a ditch.\nActing quickly, Robic regrips the wheel. After a shaky second or two, he regains control of the car. We barrel onward through the mist. His sidelong smile is pure confidence."

        "output": "his pitch count climbed so high that manager Brad Ausmus would have no choice but to make a switch.\nWhen he gave up a lead-off single to Nomar Mazara, Fulmer glanced over to the dugout.\nWhen he started Ian Desmond off with three straight balls, he knew he was only one ball away from being pulled. He fought back to strike Desmond out.\nTexas slugger Carlos Beltran was to be Fulmer's final batter one way or another. A hit, and Fulmer's day was done. Instead Beltran hit a sharp grounder to Ian Kinsler for the third out, giving Fulmer the first shutout and complete game of his career.\n\"It's special because it's the first, and hopefully there are many more to come in my career,\" Fulmer said.\nBy any measure, Sunday's game was the high point of his already impressive rookie season. Fulmer allowed only four hits, struck out nine and didn't walk a batter.\n\"I've got to believe that it's one of his highest moments, to have his first complete game, especially against an offense like that,\" said catcher James McCann.\nAfter losing the series opener on Friday, the Tigers ended the series by throwing 21 consecutive scoreless innings and winning the final two games of the series against the first-place Rangers. And they did it at their home-run-friendly home park.\n\"Having come off a three-game sweep in Seattle, it's a nice turnaround to what could have been a very tough road trip,\" Ausmus said.\nMinus a rough outing for Anibal Sanchez on Friday, Tigers pitchers had a 2.00 ERA in 54 innings during the six-game road trip.\n\"In baseball, momentum can last 10 minutes,\" Kinsler said. \"Things change very quickly. But when you shut out the Rangers two games in a row, you feel good about yourself. It's a tough ballpark to pitch in and the guys that we had on the mound the last two days did a tremendous job. Hopefully our pitchers can continue the trend and we can get a bunch more wins in a row.\"\nThe Tigers, who are 16-3 when Fulmer starts, hope that he's on the mound for many more wins down the stretch.\nBut Ausmus has acknowledged the Tigers are counting both innings and pitches with an eye toward limiting Fulmer's workload in 2016.\nAusmus believes Fulmer can make it to the end of the season if the Tigers use him wisely. But his tendency to pitch deep into games -- although in a very pitch-efficient manner -- is making them reconsider some of their assumptions.\n\"He's making it increasingly difficult to keep his innings down,\" Ausmus said dryly.\nWhen a reporter suggested that the situation might resolve itself, Ausmus replied, \"If he keeps going nine, it's not going to resolve itself.\"\nAt the moment, Fulmer is at 120 innings (not including 15 in Triple-A Toledo). He's faced 474 batters and thrown about 1,800 pitches.\nThe Tigers have no firm limit, but Ausmus said they will use upcoming off days to spread out his starts and might even use a spot starter occasionally when rosters expand in September.\n\"We're going to have to do something -- push him back, skip him at some point,\" Ausmus said. \"If he keeps pitching like this, we might have to do it more than once, because we'd like to have him around all the way through.\"\nAusmus could have saved two innings and a few dozen pitches by pulling Fulmer after the seventh Sunday, with the game well in hand.\nBut Ausmus opted to leave him in. After he breezed through the eighth, Fulmer returned to the dugout without approaching Ausmus or his pitching coach, not knowing for sure whether he would stay in for the ninth.\n\"I just did my normal thing and sat down and Brad never came and got me,\" Fulmer said. \"My mindset was just staying focused to go back out for the ninth and try to get a win for the team.\"\nAusmus said he \"didn't think twice\" about taking Fulmer out after eight.\n\"There was no wrestling (with the decision),\" he said. \"It was an opportunity for his first complete game shutout.\"\nFulmer got the job done, much to the delight of family and friends who had come from his home in the Oklahoma City area to cheer him on.\nThey saw Fulmer become the American League ERA leader (he qualified after surpassing the innings requirement on Sunday) and bolster his Rookie of the Year resume.\n\"He made a pretty good case for it today and he's done it all year,\" Ausmus said."

It will be interesting to watch how the initiative expands and if the focus on \"science for the people\" will include an emphasis on fostering dialogue and discussion among a range of users and stakeholders.\nFormative research with influentials and early adopters. Understanding impact starts before a digital journalism initiative is launched. A key method is to engage with influentials among a targeted set of users or groups, a form of \"upstream engagement\" that is often used in documentary film. This research can take the form of in-depth interviews and online surveys with influentials who are asked about the types of content and tools that would be of interest and use to their respective communities and affiliated groups. Then once a site is launched, these influentials would be asked to serve as active endorsers, promoters, and early adopters of the news project. They can also serve as bloggers or citizen journalists at the site.\nLongitudinal panel surveys of users. Once a journalism project is launched, visitors and/or registered users to the site can be randomly sampled and interviewed at regular intervals over time. These surveys would track their usage patterns, their knowledge gain; their connections and interactions with other users, their feedback on features and content of the site; and their identification and/or support for the sponsoring organization.\nAnalysis of \"quality of participation.\" Tools such as traffic counters, google analytics, and third party vendors such as Nielson Online and comScore can deliver metrics on total user size for a digital media outlet, but the quality of engagement also matters. One of the benefits of having users register at a site, is that their \"social recommendation\" activity can be tracked, specifically monitoring whether users are spreading information and promoting the site through forwarded stories, recommending content to news aggregators, or linking by way of their blogs or social media applications. Content analysis techniques should also be used to track the quality of user engagement and contributions, examining depth of content, level of disagreement versus consensus and level of social support. This type of tracking will add insight as to whether a digital journalism project is indeed serving as a mechanism for engaging users, facilitating discussion, and participation.\nTracking media and policy impact. Beyond evaluating users directly, the influence on the agenda of other media and that of community groups or policymakers are also relevant dimensions of impact. These are easier to monitor through \"google news\" alerts that track mentions in other news media and blogs. Services such as Technorati and Wikio also track the \"embeddedness\" of online content based on the number and quality of links to the site."

But truthfully, business advisers agree \u2014 it can be one of the most glaring",
        "output": "wrong decisions that entrepreneurs make as they\u2019re just starting out.\nBy default, the IRS will assume that your business is a sole proprietorship unless you claim otherwise. Often, this is what self-employed contractors do, and they never change. If this is your choice, however, remember that your business and personal funds will be considered jointly in a sole proprietorship. This means that if someone sues you, they can go after your personal assets as well as your business assets.\nBeing sole proprietor also means that all revenues will be subject to taxes. In most states, if a business name is used other than the name of the owner in a sole proprietorship, you\u2019ll need to register that name. For more information on this, look up \u201cDoing Business As\u201d or \u201cDBA\u201d online.\nYou\u2019ll find the most settled laws surrounding corporations. In fact, corporations are the oldest form of business structure in the world. With the corporation, it\u2019s easy to receive investments on return for shares, offer shares, and allocate profits according to shareholding.\nThere are also clear separations between the business dealings of shareholders and personal assets, and this accordingly limits possible issues with liability. In turn, however, your corporation will be taxed before leftover profits are dispersed as personal income to shareholders.\nIf you are interested in having investors and partners join in on your business, an LLC is a great option. The report filing and paperwork associated with forming an LLC is also less stringent than other entity types.\nGenerally speaking, you\u2019ll need the main \u201cengine\u201d for this entity, which is the Operating Agreement. This acts as a contract between all members of your LLC and is easily customizable. Many startups decide to go with an LLC because it accommodates both silent investors and working members. It\u2019s also easy to use, and all revenues are distributed easily as personal income (or loss) to members.\nA recent variant of the LLC is the single-member LLC. Each state may treat this differently. Generally speaking, LLCs were founded for partnerships, so for this offshoot, there are specific state legislatures and court clarifications required for tax protections and liability. You\u2019ll want to check in your own state for details.\nA general partnership is like a sole proprietorship as there are no protections or tax sheltering. This entity is simply two partners coming together in an agreement to create a common enterprise as equal co-owners.\nAccording to the agreement, the revenues will be disbursed to each partner as personal income. If there is a lawsuit, however, it is important to know that the full debt of the business may lay on the shoulders of each partner, which can get messy.\nAll states treat various types of business entities differently, so the requirements necessary for forming your entity will depend on your particular state. As such, the necessary information (including procedures and forms) for the formation of each of these entities can be found on your state\u2019s Secretary of State website. Additionally, you should consider local county and city laws as these may vary too.\nIt is often said that spending money on advice as it pertains to important decisions like how you should form your business is wise. That\u2019s because it can be a lot cheaper than \u201cwinging it\u201d and realizing you\u2019ve made the wrong choice in the end. Still, doing your research on the laws and regulations in your home state, county, and city is smart. And this will give you a better idea of the specific questions you\u2019ll want to ask your accountant or attorney.\nWhat you read here is in no way professional accounting or legal advice. It\u2019s simply a general guide to get you started on making this important choice in the formation and progression of your business. As a rule, handling all of these obligations is fairly straightforward, but filing services such as my own can take the startup and annual filing workload off your shoulders, for affordable fees.\nWhat\u2019s most important is to take your time and be diligent about acknowledging each aspect of your business that will be influenced by your final decision."

        "output": "the long-term consequences of extending the levies, which were instituted two years ago as an emergency budget-balancing measure.\n\"Our priority is getting the economy moving,\" John R. Rathgeber, president and chief executive of CBIA, said in a phone interview. \"Until we restore business confidence in this state ... we are not going to end this budget shortfall.\"\nThe surcharges most notably affect taxes on electric-generation facilities and corporations over the next two fiscal years. These levies alone are expected to bring more than $270 million to state coffers over that period.\nAnother measure that was set to expire, a limit on the insurance premium tax credit, will bring in additional revenue if it is extended as well.\nSteven Lanza, a University of Connecticut economist, said it is understandable that Malloy, under severe budget pressure, would grasp for revenue sources already in place rather than propose new taxes. But, he said, the governor and legislature are putting their credibility with the business community on the line if they promise the sunsetting of taxes that never go away.\n\"If taxes come and go, I think you can kind of get away with that,\" Lanza said. \"But if the business community thinks that this one is here to stay, they're going to re-evaluate their position and probably interpret this tax now as essentially a permanent fixture.\"\n\"One of (the) most important criteria for (a) business person, whether large or small, is that there is some assurance of predictability,\" said Tony Sheridan, president and chief executive of the Chamber of Commerce of Eastern Connecticut. \"When the state makes a commitment to eliminate a tax ... that's a commitment; business people run with that and say, 'Good, we can plan the next couple of years.'\"\nKen Holt, a spokesman for the power-generation firm Dominion, said the extended surcharge inevitably will show up in rates state residents pay for electricity - rates that are already the highest in the continental United States. Dominion's tax alone would be $42 million a year under Malloy's plan, while the traditional-energy industry as a whole - coal, natural gas, nuclear and oil - would pay a total of $76 million annually.\nConnecticut is the only state in the nation with a broad-based tax on the production of electricity, Holt said.\n\"We're disappointed with the governor's decision to break his promise,\" Holt said in a phone interview. \"By reintroducing the tax in this budget, customers will be the ones to ultimately bear the burden.\"\nRathgeber of CBIA said the General Assembly needs to work hard to find more spending cuts, focusing on a lean bureaucracy while spending money on education, public safety, infrastructure improvements and economic development.\n\"We need to aggressively pursue policies that will grow the state's economy and close out what has become an endless cycle of budget deficits,\" he said in a statement. \"Connecticut must make its tax system more competitive if we're going to attract private investment, allow businesses to grow and get people back to work.\""

The collection has since blossomed into thousands of pieces - enough to fill a museum.\nAnd that's where they're headed.\nWith the help of a volunteer board likewise dedicated to the days of the Old West, Birdeno, 67, has established the Silver Screen Cowboy Museum on U.S. 50, two miles west of Newton.\nA sneak preview is planned for Feb. 14, with a catered Valentine's Day dinner and a program. Movie cowboy Dale Berry will open the show, with ZERF, the singing cowboy from Manhattan, presenting his \"six-string justice\" songs about the Kansas frontier. Honored guests are Paul Mix, a cousin of silent film icon Tom Mix, and Hooter Gibson, a cousin of actor Hoot Gibson.\nBirdeno's collection hearkens back to the silent-screen days and moves forward to scores of lesser-known Hollywood cowboys as well as popular favorites Tom Mix, The Lone Ranger, Roy Rogers and Gene Autry.\nAmong local cowboy aficionados whom Birdeno admittedly roped into helping set up the museum is retired Reno County Senior Court Judge Steven Becker.\nThey're a couple of wannabe hombres, the two admit. On a work day at the museum, they showed up attired in blue jeans and Western shirts, boots and felt cowboy hats.\nThe choices for play in their boyhood days were limited to \"Cops and Robbers\" or \"Cowboys and Indians.\"\n\"For me, it was always 'Cowboys and Indians,' \" Becker said.\nBecker houses his own museum of working cowboy artifacts in the century-old Medora Hotel on K-61 north of Hutchinson - a place he calls The Bunkhouse.\nBirdeno's interest lies in the Wild West that emerged from Hollywood: the cowboy movie heroes whose riding and roping brought the romance and glamour of the Old West - even though they often used doubles, and some didn't know which side of a horse to mount.\nOnly a few true lawmen and cowboys made the movies. As for real-life robbers and outlaws, Birdeno knows only the one member of the famed Dalton brothers, Emmett, who survived to make his way to Hollywood as a consultant to moviemakers.\nBirdeno's memory holds a catalog of the scores of former actors and the parts they played.\nThe holster he wears is autographed by Roy Rogers' daughter, Cheryl Rogers, and he has met Paul Mix, cousin of the late Tom Mix.\nAt the Silver Screen Museum, the vast collection of photos, many of them autographed, along with posters, publicity still shots and other memorabilia, have been sorted. Many are in place, though more await being hung on walls or arranged in display cases.\nThe fun of establishing the Silver Screen Cowboy Museum is the authenticity of the location, Becker said.\n\"Kansas is so rich in cowboy history - Abilene, Ellsworth, Wichita, Dodge City. Being a part of Kansas, to me, means to be a part of the cowboy era,\" he said.\nFor Birdeno and his museum gang, Jerry Shell and Jack Mace, it's a way of remembering an era that entertained moviegoers for decades.\n\"The museum is a return to the day of the Saturday matinee,\" Birdeno said, \"when the heroes wore white hats and fancy gun rigs and rode prancing steeds. The bad guys in black hats rode ordinary horses - and maybe, just maybe, the leading lady got a kiss.\""

        "input": "It had been a hectic day for Shaharyar M. Khan. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman, on his first visit to Karachi after beginning his second stint at the helm of PCB, carried out a series of meetings and also addressed what was quite an explosive media conference at the",
        "output": "National Stadium Friday afternoon.\nOur meeting for an interview was lined up for the evening and as I entered his hotel my fears were that I might be interrupting his nap. But just minutes later, Shaharyar entered the room in a sporty outfit that included a bright-coloured ICC T-shirt. I greeted him with a \u201cYou look good, sir!\u201d comment and he replied with a beaming smile: \u201cWell, I expect that after a good swim\u201d.\nThere is a brief chitchat but well aware that Shaharyar has to leave for a few pressing commitments we get down to business almost straightaway. The interview begins with the inevitable question as to what prompted him to accept a role that was snatched away prematurely from him and that too at the ripe old age of 80. We move to the Big Three issue when he tells him how he helped save sub-continent\u2019s bid for the previous edition of the ICC World Cup.\nOur conversation gets briefly interrupted by Agha Akbar, the veteran journalist now working as PCB\u2019s media man. After receiving a phone call he tells us that the last-remaining legal hassle for the Board was over after the Islamabad High Court threw out a writ petition against the Board\u2019s new constitution. He informs us that IHC has even fined the four petitioners Rs 1 million each for misguiding the court and concealing facts. \u201cThe money will have to be paid directly to PCB,\u201d says Akbar. \u201cIt will help us cover our legal costs,\u201d he adds with a smile. Shaharyar nods his head in agreement.\nFrom then onwards, we got down to a formal Q/A session. Following are the excerpts.\nTNS: Pakistan is one of the various countries marginalised by the so-called Big Three. Do you think that under your command PCB can manage to regain its lost status in world cricket?\nShaharyar Khan: Well, if you consider that there was a time when our stake in international cricket had gone below-zero I would say that at the moment we aren\u2019t in a very bad position. I must praise Najam Sethi here because he is the one who helped us recover from a terrible situation. We were completely isolated and utterly marginalised. But he managed to get us a good deal in the end. Now we are part of the action and would be getting important positions (in the ICC).\nThat said, I would add that the power division was always there. In the past, too, India would dictate terms with Australia as its number two. England was ranked a bit lower and then came the other countries. The thing is that the division has become official now. PCB never had any huge clout (in ICC) but we did have goodwill. I still remember that when we were jointly bidding for the World Cup with India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh our effort almost went down the drain because of a faulty bid from India. I played some role and even though the joint bid by Australia and New Zealand was much better we were given an extension and later the Indians managed to come out with a better bid and eventually the World Cup was awarded to the sub-continent. I\u2019m confident that Pakistan will continue playing its role and we will make efforts to build bridges and mend fences for the greater interest of the game.\nTNS: There are expectations that using your diplomatic experience and goodwill you will help PCB revive Indo-Pak bilateral ties. How confident are you about it?\nSK: Reviving cricketing ties with India is an important task but a lot of it will depend on the relations between the two countries. I certainly enjoy goodwill in India and will use it to pave the path for a revival but the issue will eventually be decided on the basis of the overall Indo-Pak relations.\nTNS: Do you think that bringing normalcy in Indo-Pak cricketing relations is even a possibility considering the volatile ties between the two nations?\nSK: You should understand that since the 2008 Mumbai attacks the general public of India has turned against Pakistan. This wasn\u2019t the case in the past. And the only way we can move forward is by having closure on the Mumbai attack case.\nTNS: Do you believe that having a hardliner like Narendra Modi as India\u2019s prime minister would make things worse?\nSK: It\u2019s too early to reach any conclusion. He (Modi) began on a positive note by inviting our prime minister for his swearing-in ceremony. We will have to wait and see how things go on in the coming days.\nTNS: At the moment, Pakistan does not come across as a team that can win the World Cup next year. What sort of recipe do you have in mind to boost Pakistan\u2019s chances?\nSK: I do agree that our team doesn\u2019t look like a winning unit. I mean we don\u2019t have the sort of stars needed to win a major title. Maybe the team is good enough to win a match or two but to play well in seven, eight matches at a stretch in a tournament like the World Cup seems tough, at the moment. Frankly, we don\u2019t have impactful players like Inzamam (ul-Haq) or the fiery Shoaib Akhtar or Saqlain Mushtaq. We might not even have Saeed Ajmal for the World Cup.\nI believe that our team needs players who can rise to the occasion. You need them to shine in crisis situations. I will not interfere in team selection but I will provide guidance. I\u2019ve been talking to Misbah (ul-Haq), Waqar (Younis) and Moin Khan. I\u2019ve been telling them to pick people who can fight for the team because we don\u2019t need the ones who would abandon the team in difficult situations. You need boys like Fawad Alam who have the guts to handle crisis situations. Also I believe that playing the boys at the right position is very important. Personally I would expect Sohaib Maqsood to move up the order but they wasted him at No 7 position.\nTNS: Misbah has come under a lot of criticism especially after the disappointing tour of Sri Lanka. But you continue to back him, why?\nSK: Take a look at the bigger picture. Misbah has been your most prolific batsman during the last few years. He has mostly done a decent job as captain, too. Yes he had a bad series in Sri Lanka but that happens. I would expect Misbah to grit his teeth and bounce back. But I would also clarify one thing here. We are still discussing this issue. I\u2019ve been to talking to all relevant people and will take a final decision (on captaincy) in a week\u2019s time.\nTNS: What are the most important tasks for you as PCB chairman?\nSK: My biggest goal is revamp our domestic cricket. It\u2019s been in a shambles for a long time. We have to go to the grassroots and invest in schools, colleges, clubs etc. We have prepared a blueprint for the development of grassroots cricket and are now looking for sponsors. We have discussed the issue with Aman Foundation who are interested and will also go to all top business houses because that is the area from where we can provide a lasting boost to Pakistan cricket.\nTNS: There is a general impression that there are lots of politics, intrigues and other such stuff going on in Pakistan cricket both in the field and also in the boardroom. How much of that do you think is true?\nSK: Not much. I mean you keep hearing stories about politics and conspiracies but most of it is nonsense. We don\u2019t have many political types in our board anyway. There are a couple of them in our governing board but they are hardly the types who would indulge in politics.\nTNS: There is also this impression that PCB is infested with various vested-interest elements and incompetent officials. Do you agree with that?\nSK: I don\u2019t agree with that. I\u2019m pretty happy with the team (of officials) in the PCB. Subhan Ahmad (COO) is a terrific, sound person who has great experience. Zakir Khan, I know, has been there for donkey\u2019s years. Previously I was a bit unsure about him but now that I\u2019m back I can see that he has really improved and deals with important matters professionally.\nTNS: PCB, overall, is like a ship sinking under its own weight because of an inflated payroll. What are you planning to do about it?\nSK: Yes, downsizing is certainly on our agenda but we will have to do in a humane manner. We must cut our coat according to our cloth. We would downsize but there won\u2019t be one sweeping action as we plan to do it gradually.\nTNS: In the past PCB had been making tall claims about its plans of successfully launching the so-called Pakistan Super League. But one of the initial decisions you\u2019ve made was to shelf it. Why?\nSK: It wasn\u2019t feasible. We received some below-par bids for the league and knew straight away that if we went ahead with it the Board would not be able to achieve its targets. We need it to be a financial success as well as a cricketing success but that can\u2019t happen at the moment. You look around and you\u2019ll see that various other (Twenty20) leagues happening in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka or even in the Caribbean are not very successful. The only league that can boast both financial and cricketing success is the IPL (Indian Premier League) but that\u2019s a different story.\nTNS: How do you think your second stint is going to be different from you first one as PCB chairman?\nSK: In the past PCB chairman would be like a dictator with sweeping powers. But not anymore. The new PCB would be democratic, we will make sure that it is. I plan to have five things given utmost importance in PCB: continuity, transparency, democracy, balance and stability. Without things like continuity, transparency and balance we cannot have progress. I believe my biggest task it to make sure that the board instills all of these much-needed elements.\nWe had planned for a 40-minute interview but over conversation had already stretched over an hour. But Shaharyar, in his element, didn\u2019t seem to mind. As we were wrapping things up, he assures me that under his watch things in Pakistan cricket will improve. We shook hands and he left, asking me to stay in touch. \u201cI have to be somewhere,\u201d he tells me. It has been a long, tiring day but Shaharyar is looking forward to some more action. His critics might reject him as an octogenarian will little left in him to offer. But at that particular moment, he comes across as just the person that Pakistan cricket needs \u2013 a wise, old man with a plan."

        "input": "Jacob Hale Russell is assistant professor of law at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey.\nJustice Kennedy\u2019s retirement has prompted a chorus of cries by Democrats to resuscitate a seemingly unlikely idea: \u201cpacking\u201d the Supreme Court.\nFor would-be packers, expanding the court from nine to 11 justices, if and when the",
        "output": "Democrats take back executive and legislative power, provides the only opportunity to regain a liberal majority on the court. A packing approach, in proponents\u2019 view, is justified by the need to \u201cfight dirty\u201d in exigent times. The equally vociferous refrain of anti-packers worries about protecting the integrity of court: It\u2019s not worth compromising the institution, they say, for a temporary policy result.\nThe battle over court packing is being fought on the wrong terms. Americans of all political stripes should want to see the court expanded, but not to get judicial results more favorable to one party. Instead, we need a bigger court because the current institutional design is badly broken. The right approach isn\u2019t a revival of FDR\u2019s court packing plan, which would have increased the court to 15, or current plans, which call for 11. Instead, the right size is much, much bigger. Three times its current size, or 27, is a good place to start, but it\u2019s quite possible the optimal size is even higher. This needn\u2019t be done as a partisan gambit to stack more liberals on the court. Indeed, the only sensible way to make this change would be to have it phase in gradually, perhaps adding two justices every other year, to prevent any one president and Senate from gaining an unwarranted advantage.\nSuch a proposal isn\u2019t unconstitutional, nor even that radical. There\u2019s nothing sacred about the number nine, which isn\u2019t found in the constitution and instead comes from an 1869 act of congress. Congress can pass a law changing the court\u2019s size at any time. That contrasts it with other potentially meritorious reform ideas, like term limits, which would require amending the constitution and thus are unlikely to succeed. And countries, with much smaller populations, have much larger high courts. In 1869, when the number nine was chosen, the U.S. was roughly a tenth of its current size, laws and government institutions were far smaller and less complex, and the volume of cases was vastly lower. Supreme Court enlargement only seems radical because we have lost touch with the fundamentals of our living, breathing constitution. The flawed debate over court-packing is an opportunity to reexamine our idea of what a Supreme Court is, and some foundational, and wrong, assumptions.\nThe court\u2019s current design is troubling. Proof is found in a commonplace observation at every mid-term and presidential election, when it is said that the most critical outcome of the election will be the one or handful of justices appointed to the Supreme Court by the President. The refrain has become so common that we have become blind to its frightening implications. How could it be that the most important decision a President makes is picking one non-elected lawyer, distinguished at this point mainly by their ability to avoid ever saying anything controversial, to a court that decides cases at an average rate of one or two a week?\nOur framers\u2019 conception of constitutional interpretation was far more complicated, messy, and democratic. Constitutional interpretation was seen as fundamentally in the hands of the people, not of courts, much less of nine unelected justices, as Larry Kramer and others have cogently demonstrated. Judicial supremacy, the idea that the court is the ultimate interpreter of the Constitution, took off later, arguably not gaining wide acceptance until the past half-century. In that transition, we the people abdicated our constitutional role\u2014creating and interpreting fundamental rights as part of an ongoing process\u2014to a non-transparent, non-democratic, non-representative body of nine. That is dangerous: we are taught, from our earliest civics courses, to revere the court as higher, more \u201csupreme,\u201d and less subject to the whims of politics\u2014despite the increasingly close splits and increasingly frequent reversals of precedent, the political maelstrom surrounding each nomination, and the fact that it is just one of several co-equal branches of government. We have been lulled into believing that the Supreme Court possesses oracular powers to divine the Constitution\u2019s meaning in a way the rest of us can\u2019t.\nRecent years\u2019 decisions, and the frequency of 5-4 splits, have made it difficult to disagree with the fact that the Supreme Court is a fundamentally political, partisan body. How we got to that point is contestable. Liberals might date true partisanship\u2014when the court went from being liberals and conservatives to being Democrats and Republicans\u2014to Bush vs. Gore. Conservatives might say liberals themselves opened the floodgates to politicization with the Warren court\u2019s expansive decisions on rights. Legal theorists might suggest this is simply part of the fundamental nature of law. As first-year law students learn, \u201ceasy cases\u201d are rare and laws are never unambiguous. There is no unanimously agreed upon mode of interpretation. And even if we agreed on a mode of interpretation\u2014even if, for instance, originalism was universally adopted as a means of constitutional interpretation\u2014what the constitution \u201coriginally meant\u201d is almost always up for reasonable debate.\nA much larger court would make the Supreme Court more comparably sized to our federal circuit courts, as law professor Jonathan Turley observed in a his 2012 call for a 19-person court. Those regional circuit courts are composed of anywhere from 6 to 29 judges. Not all judges sit on all cases heard by the circuits, as most cases are decided by smaller panels of three. In a small number of cases, the entire circuit sits to review a previously convened panel\u2019s decision. The larger size of the circuits, then, yields two advantages. First, it reduces the influence of a single, swing voter like Kennedy or, before him, Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor. Second, there is variance in the panels, which are randomly drawn. Even on a supposedly liberal circuit, like the west coast\u2019s 9th Circuit, cases are sometimes heard and decided by panels composed of three conservatives. The system promotes variety and prevents excessive entrenchment of, say, a 5-4 majority. This is counterbalanced by the fact that the full circuit can choose to review the decision, providing consistency. A modified version of this approach could be adopted for an an enlarged Supreme Court.\nThere are further benefits to a much larger Supreme Court. A larger court could hear more cases, which could help break up the cabal that currently controls the court\u2019s docket. One of the most terrifying aspects of current Supreme Court practice is the politicking to get particular cases before it, which benefits a small cadre of insiders who are usually the system\u2019s most staunch defenders. Unlike circuit courts, the Supreme Court picks and chooses which appeals it wants to hear. Currently it grants hearings for only about 80 out of 8,000 cases filed each term, making it five times harder to get your case in front of the court than to get into the nation\u2019s most competitive colleges. That\u2019s, put plainly, absurd. Because the court issues so few opinions, its few pronouncements have outsize influence. What\u2019s especially disturbing is how the 80 cases are chosen. An increasingly small number of lawyers, who are usually past Supreme Court clerks themselves and who know what the court will look for in a petition for hearing, are responsible for most of the arguments before the court. A 2014 Reuters investigation found that just 66 lawyers, of whom 63 were white and 58 were men, were six times as likely to get their cases heard than any other lawyers. Half were former Supreme Court clerks. By hearing many more cases, a larger court would break up this scheme. A larger docket would be healthy in other ways, allowing a uniform national resolution of more disagreements between regional circuits. There is nothing in the Constitution that envisions the court hearing such a small fraction of the nation\u2019s cases, and the framers lived in an era of extremely low federal judicial volume and minimal influence of the Supreme Court. At three times its current size, the court\u2019s ratio of justices to filed appeals would be more in line with that of the circuits.\nThe greatest feature of an expansion is that it would convert what currently seems like an unavoidable vice\u2014the court\u2019s politicization\u2014into a strength. Law cannot be divorced from politics. But politics can be made to work better with better institutional design. Just as a 9-person Congress would be highly undemocratic, dangerously powerful, and ultimately ineffective, a 9-person court is no better. Larger bodies have some inherent features that are more democratic and effective: they are more representative, and they can include a more diverse group; they can do more work; their splits are less likely to be narrow and therefore arbitrary; they have more regular, natural turnover, and any one vacancy would not dominate the political scene as it does today. If politics are inevitable, they should at least be made to work: a larger number means Republican justices and Democratic justices would be less likely to engage in simple bloc voting. With a larger body, more natural coalitions can develop, yielding richer dynamics than the 5-4 decisions that have become all too common these days. (Because justices serve for life, the coalitions could be more free-flowing and less beholden to the party system, unlike legislators who must maintain party support for committee assignments and reelection.) Finally, court size isn\u2019t one of the design features that supposedly insulates the judiciary from the tyranny of the majority, unlike lifetime appointments.\nThe framers would be appalled by the degree to which we have abdicated responsibility for the constitution to a small, homogenous, unelected group. We should be appalled, too. But there is a solution. Enlargement will involve sacrifices by partisans on both sides, as a larger court will be less predictable. For liberals, it may be hard to move past their memories of a court that served them well over a half-century in expanding rights when political branches would not do the same. For conservatives, it may be hard to give up control just as they are finally cementing the victory of a multi-decade campaign to retake the judiciary. But increasing court size should not favor one particular party, and should appeal to all Americans\u2014save perhaps the Supreme Court bar and former clerks."

        "output": "subsidiary of CGI Group, built the website, HealthCare.gov, which was plagued by error messages and slow speeds for weeks after the launch. The glitches created a political crisis for President Barack Obama, threatening the roll-out of his signature healthcare law and emboldening Republican foes to call for its repeal.\n\u201cAs CMS moves forward in our efforts to help consumers access quality, affordable health coverage, we have selected Accenture to become the lead contractor for the HealthCare.gov portal and to prepare for next year\u2019s open enrollment period,\u201d the agency said in a statement.\nCGI Federal said on Friday that its contract, which was originally awarded in 2011 and is scheduled to end February 28, would not be renewed.\nAccenture said the contract was worth $45 million for the initial phase of the project, and the Washington Post reported that the final value of the one-year contract would be about $90 million.\n\u201cAccenture will bring deep healthcare industry insight as well as proven experience building large-scale, public-facing websites to continue improving HealthCare.gov,\u201d David Moskovitz, chief executive of Accenture Federal Services, said in a statement.\nObama has said the fiasco with the website has made him want to overhaul the way the federal government buys technology services. Critics say the system favors large, established contractors such as CGI.\nAlthough the site is vastly improved, technical glitches continue to bedevil enrollment. The improvements allowed more than 1.1 million people to shop for and enroll in insurance on HealthCare.gov by the end of 2013, far short of original hopes.\nThe deadline for signing up for 2014 health insurance under the Affordable Care Act is March 31, meaning Accenture will take over at a time when the government needs the site to handle what it hopes will be a surge of last-minute sign-ups."

        "output": "poison or razors in the candy than they do about the sheer amount of sugar their child will be consuming over the next few weeks.\nEpidemics of obesity, attention deficit disorders, and food allergies have made parents much more conscious of what their children are consuming on a day to day basis. Some studies have shown that some food substances, like sugar, can actually be addictive and habit forming. Any parent who has been chased through the house by a child begging, cajoling, or bargaining for just \u201cone more\u201d Halloween treat would probably find that conclusion to be a no-brainer. More and more events are being celebrated with food, mostly sweet treats, but none of them approach the sheer volume of Halloween. The treats collected from Halloween can fill entire pillow cases, and if doled out judiciously, can last until nearly Easter. Unfortunately, judicious distribution of Halloween treats is extremely difficult. Halloween treats constitute a draw that is almost impossible to disregard.\nThere are many creative options now available for parents who are looking to find ways to part their children from some of the treats they\u2019ve collected on Halloween. The Switch Witch is a popular option. The Switch Witch comes in the days following Halloween and trades treats for a desired toy or other gift. Some dentists offer to trade Halloween treats for dental care accouterments such as toothbrushes and toothpaste. Other dentists are taking donations of the treats to send to military personnel deployed overseas. The whole gist is to lessen the amount of candy children have at their disposal. There\u2019s another movement that is gaining ground that can reduce the amount of treats kids are bringing home on Halloween.\nThe Teal Pumpkin Project is a new tradition that was started by the Food Allergy Research and Education foundation. With roughly one in 13 kids suffering from life threatening food allergies to what are collectively known as the top eight (milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, shellfish, fish and wheat), this is a way for these children to participate in the fun of Trick-Or-Treating without being at risk for a life threatening allergic reaction.\nThis movement can benefit so many more than just those that suffer from allergies. Juvenile diabetes is increasing in prevalence, along with children who don\u2019t tolerate food dyes, or have gluten intolerances. The list of children who can\u2019t have candy grows ever longer. Add to that the parents who are just tired of fighting to keep the sugary Halloween treats to a minimum, and you have a great second option. It doesn\u2019t have to be bad options. In days past, the only alternatives to candy were fruit or pencils, and kids weren\u2019t all that interested. Now, an abundance of inexpensive and attractive options exist. Glow stick bracelets, stickers, rainbow bands, trading cards, the options are endless. Food alternatives don\u2019t detract from the fun of Halloween. They can actually enhance the experience for kids who aren\u2019t able to indulge in typical Halloween treats, or for those who will wind up trading half their treats for something else anyway."

He mentioned that the school needed to expand its boarding facilities introduced three years ago, as well as build a new library complex, an ICT centre, a distant learning centre and a demonstration school for its interns.\nThe Principal described the situation as very alarming, adding, \"the tempo of constructional activities going on as to be found around the Ghana Book Trust and opposite the Institute of Professional Studies was so high that soon, the College would lose all its undeveloped land to private individuals to the disadvantage of the College and, therefore, the nation\".

She, therefore, called on the Government through the Ghana Education Service, to restore the school's land to it.

He was 66 and lived in Fairfax, Va.\nLee Edwards, a friend of",
        "output": "Mr. Weyrich\u2019s for four decades and a distinguished fellow at the Heritage Foundation, the conservative research group that Mr. Weyrich helped found, confirmed the death, at a hospital in Northern Virginia. The family did not release a cause, Mr. Edwards said, but Mr. Weyrich had many health problems, including diabetes. His legs were amputated at the knee in 2005, and he had broken his back in a fall some years earlier.\nA writer, a lobbyist and an organizer on behalf of conservative causes and especially social conservatism, Mr. Weyrich (pronounced WY-rick) was one of the far right\u2019s most unbending ideologues. He was widely credited with coining the phrase \u201cmoral majority\u201d as a rallying label for social conservatives. It became the name of the religion-based political organization that was led by the Rev. Jerry Falwell.\nA deacon in the ultra-conservative Melkite Greek Catholic Church, Mr. Weyrich openly fused his faith and his politics.\nFor more than a quarter of a century, Mr. Weyrich was one of the Republican Party\u2019s leading antagonists from the right. President Ronald Reagan, he said, had overemphasized economic issues and kept social issues \u201con the back burner,\u201d as he wrote on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times in 1984.\nIn 1989, he testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee that the first President Bush\u2019s nominee for secretary of defense, John G. Tower, was unqualified for the post because he was a drinker and a womanizer, issues that eventually doomed the nomination. More recently, he accused the current President Bush of profligate domestic spending, and he was a critic of the Iraq war, asserting that a war conducted to spread democracy rather than to protect vital national interests deviated from conservative principles.\nPerhaps more than anything, Mr. Weyrich was a nondeviator in his unswerving faith in small government, free-market economics, the right to life and the sanctity of the family. One possible exception: as a lifelong train enthusiast, he was an ardent advocate of government support for Amtrak.\nMr. Weyrich started the Heritage Foundation, a Washington research organization whose express aim is to influence Congress, in 1973 with Ed Feulner, helped by $250,000 from the Colorado beer magnate Joseph Coors. Both he and Mr. Feulner were Congressional aides at the time.\nIt was Mr. Weyrich\u2019s conviction in making such sweeping statements \u2014 and the prickly, impatient, let\u2019s-get-it-done manner with which he did business \u2014 that made him an architect of the conservative movement of the last part of the 20th century.\nRichard A. Viguerie, the conservative direct-mail pioneer, said in a telephone interview that Mr. Weyrich was the least known of the four pillars of modern conservatism, the others being Barry Goldwater, William F. Buckley Jr. and Ronald Reagan.\nPaul Michael Weyrich was born in Racine, Wis., on Oct. 7, 1942. His father, Ignatius, was a German immigrant who worked for 50 years stoking the furnace in a Catholic hospital and who raised his son to treat religious and political matters alike with deep seriousness.\nMr. Weyrich attended the University of Wisconsin but did not graduate, supporting himself at first as a reporter for television and radio and at The Milwaukee Sentinel. He eventually became the news director for KQXI in Denver, and from there he went to Washington as an aide to Senator Gordon Allott, a conservative from Colorado.\nA year or so later, Mr. Weyrich attended a meeting of aides to Congressional liberals that was also attended by lawyers, lobbyists and Brookings Institute fellows. What he witnessed was a revelation, he said. The subject of the meeting was President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s failure to move forward on fair housing legislation.\nFrom that moment on, he said, he devoted himself to creating the same system for the right.\nMr. Weyrich\u2019s survivors include his wife of 45 years, Joyce; two daughters, Dawn and Diana, and three sons, Peter, Stephen and Andrew.\nDavid D.

Specifically, Holston Middle School Principal Kathryn Lutton should have reported the threat to the school resource officer.\nWhen asked if she will face any disciplinary action, Thomas said, \"All of this is under review. There is going to be accountability for not following the protocol.\"\nThe USA TODAY NETWORK -Tennessee has asked Knox County Schools for copies of relevant policies and protocols but they were not immediately made available Tuesday.\nLutton declined to comment and deferred questions to the district's central office.\n\"My school has been at the forefront of this but this situation doesn't just encompass our school,\" she said. \"It's a district-wide issue.\"\nThe USA TODAY NETWORK-Tennessee is not identifying the name of the boy who allegedly made the threat, but documents from the Knoxville Police Department show two girls in the school had reported that he was talking about bringing a gun to school on Feb. 15.\nThe girls reported that to Lutton, who phoned the boy's mother that afternoon and arranged to meet with her in the morning.\nMeanwhile, law enforcement who had independently learned of the threat were conducting their own investigation and were unable to reach school security officials.\nNormally, a principal would be required to immediately report a threat to law enforcement, the school resource officer and the superintendent's office, but Thomas said Tuesday that didn't happen.\nHe said he didn't have a date for when the protocol was last reviewed with school principals.\n\"They have been reminded and there have been trainings, but obviously if someone\u2019s not following it we\u2019re not doing something right,\" he said. \"That's something I'm going to deal with.

It was last reviewed last summer, he said.\nSchool officials are scheduled to meet Wednesday with the Knoxville Police Department and Knoxville Sheriff's Office to review the breakdown and discuss security moving forward.\nA handful of parents interviewed outside Holston Middle School Tuesday said they were unaware of the situation, including both the original threat as well as the communications breakdown.\nMichael Drew, who said he heard about it from a co-worker Tuesday morning, said the district should act more quickly in notifying parents of threats of violence. He was at school around 2:30 p.m. Tuesday, an hour before the dismissal time, because he said he was concerned about his daughter.\n\"I got a message yesterday about it being an in-service day yesterday, but I didn\u2019t hear nothing about the threat from Thursday and I thought that was kind of weird and strange,\" Drew said.\n\"You have to take threats like that real serious, especially with what\u2019s happening all over the country in schools.\"\nSarah Wilson, whose granddaughter is in the eighth grade, also said she hadn't heard of the threat or the breakdown. In the past she said parents have received an \"all call\" when a threat is reported.\n\"It concerns me that they weren\u2019t able to get a hold of anybody,\" she said upon learning of the situation. \"We\u2019ve had several threats at this school in the last three years since we\u2019ve been here. It really frightens the children. It upsets them for the whole day. Parents have to drop their kids off right in the middle of it.

No breach is acceptable.\"\nHill said she was made aware of it \"after the fact\" but did not recall whether she knew about the breakdown during her discussion with a reporter Monday.\n\"It raises several questions but beyond that I don't know the answer to any of those at this point,\" said board member Mike McMillan. \"I think right now it would be premature for me to comment too much until I have more information.\"\nUSA TODAY NETWORK- Tennessee reporter Tyler Whetstone contributed to this report."

I can look at some of the things I have done with horror and loathing. So apparently I am allowed to loathe and hate some of the things my enemies do. Now that I come to think of it, I remember Christian teachers telling me long ago that I must hate a bad man's actions, but not hate the bad man: or, as they would say, hate the sin but not the sinner.\nFor a long time I used to think this a silly, straw-splitting distinction: how could you hate what a man did and not hate the man? But years later it occurred to me that there was one man to whom I had been doing this all of my life--namely myself. However much I might dislike my own cowardice or conceit or greed, I went on loving myself. There had never been the slightest difficulty about it. In fact the very reason why I hated the things was that I loved the man. Just because I loved myself, I was sorry to find that I was the sort of man who did those things. Consequently, Christianity does not want us to reduce by one atom the hatred we feel for cruelty and treachery. We ought to hate them. Not one word of what we have said about them needs to be unsaid. But it does want us to hate them in the same way in which we hate things in ourselves: being sorry that the man should have done such things, and hoping, if it is anyway possible, that somehow, sometime, somewhere he can be cured and made human again.\n. . . I imagine somebody will say, 'Well, if one is allowed to condemn the enemy's acts, and punish him, and kill him, what difference is left between Christian morality and the ordinary view?' All the difference in the world. Remember, we Christians think man lives for ever. Therefore, what really matters is those little marks or twists on the central, inside part of the soul which are going to turn it, in the long run, into a heavenly or a hellish creature. We may kill if necessary, but we must not hate and enjoy hating. We may punish if necessary, but we must not enjoy it... Even while we kill and punish we must try to feel about the enemy as we feel about ourselves - to wish that he were not so bad, to hope that he may, in this world or another, be cured: in fact, to wish his good. This is what is meant in the Bible by loving him: wishing his good, not feeling fond of him nor saying he is nice when he is not.\nUp at one end of the hangar about a dozen men were lying in a row on the concrete floor. These, it was explained, were S.S. officers who had been segregated from the other prisoners. Among them was a man in dingy civilian clothes who was lying with his arm across his face and apparently asleep. He had strange and horribly deformed feet. The two of them were quite symmetrical, but they were clubbed out into an extraordinary globular shape which made them more like a horse's hoof than anything human. As we approached the group, the little Jew seemed to be working himself up into a state of excitement.\n'That's the real swine!' he said, and suddenly he lashed out with his heavy army boot and caught the prostrate man a fearful kick right on the bulge of one of his deformed feet.\n'Get up, you swine!' he shouted as the man started out of sleep, and then repeated something of the kind in German. The prisoner scrambled to his feet and stood clumsily to attention. With the same air of working himself up into a fury -- indeed he was almost dancing up and down as he spoke -- the Jew told us the prisoner's history. He was a 'real' Nazi: his party number indicated that he had been a member since the very early days, and he had held a post corresponding to a General in the political branch of the S.S. It could be taken as quite certain that he had had charge of concentration camps and had presided over tortures and hangings. In short, he represented everything that we had been fighting against during the past five years.\nMeanwhile, I was studying his appearance. Quite apart from the scrubby, unfed, unshaven look that a newly captured man generally has, he was a disgusting specimen. But he did not look brutal or in any way frightening: merely neurotic and, in a low way, intellectual. His pale, shifty eyes were deformed by powerful spectacles. He could have been an unfrocked clergyman, an actor ruined by drink, or a spiritualist medium. I have seen very similar people in London common lodging houses, and also in the Reading Room of the British Museum. Quite obviously he was mentally unbalanced -- indeed, only doubtfully sane, though at this moment sufficiently in his right mind to be frightened of getting another kick. And yet everything that the Jew was telling me of his history could have been true, and probably was true! So the Nazi torturer of one's imagination, the monstrous figure against whom one had struggled for so many years, dwindled to this pitiful wretch, whose obvious need was not for punishment, but for some kind of psychological treatment.\nLater, there were further humiliations. Another S.S. officer, a large brawny man, was ordered to strip to the waist and show the blood group number tattooed on his under-arm; another was forced to explain to us how he had lied about being a member of the S.S. and attempted to pass himself off as an ordinary soldier of the Wehrmacht. I wondered whether the Jew was getting any real kick out of this new-found power that he was exercising. I concluded that he wasn't really enjoying it, and that he was merely -- like a man in a brothel, or a boy smoking his first cigar, or a tourist traipsing round a picture gallery -- telling himself that he was enjoying it, and behaving as he had planned to behave in the days he was helpless.\nIt is absurd to blame any German or Austrian Jew for getting his own back on the Nazis. Heaven knows what scores this particular man may have had to wipe out; very likely his whole family had been murdered; and after all, even a wanton kick to a prisoner is a very tiny thing compared with the outrages committed by the Hitler regime. But what this scene, and much else that I saw in Germany, brought home to me was that the whole idea of revenge and punishment is a childish daydream. Properly speaking, there is no such thing as revenge. Revenge is an act which you want to commit when you are powerless and because you are powerless: as soon as the sense of impotence is removed, the desire evaporates also.\nWho would not have jumped for joy, in 1940, at the thought of seeing S.S. officers kicked and humiliated? But when the thing becomes possible, it is merely pathetic and disgusting. It is said that when Mussolini's corpse was exhibited in public, an old woman drew a revolver and fired five shots into it, exclaiming, 'Those are for my five sons!' It is the kind of story that the newspapers make up, but it might be true. I wonder how much satisfaction she got out of those five shots, which, doubtless, she had dreamed years earlier of firing. The condition of her being able to get close enough to Mussolini to shoot at him was that he should be a corpse.\nI don't really have anything else to add at this point; that's just what I've been thinking about over the last few days."

Just days after his release, O'Hearn, 30, took his own life.\nVeterans' suicides, like O'Hearn's, are an ongoing crisis. Every day, 20 U.S. veterans die by suicide, according to VA statistics. The VA estimated that veterans are more than twice as likely to die by suicide as other members of the public. Their rate of suicide is increasing, just as it is rising among the general population.\nSome veterans die by suicide at the very hospitals designed to help them. This month, three veterans took their own lives at VA facilities in just five days.\nOne veteran shot himself in a busy waiting room at an Austin, Texas, clinic. Two others took their lives at VA centers in Georgia.\nOver the past two years, there have been more than 260 suicide attempts at VA facilities, according to the agency, though a vast majority of those attempts \u2014 240 \u2014 were thwarted.\nIn a statement, VA Press Secretary Curt Cashour said, \"Our deepest condolences go out to the loved ones affected by these deaths.

As it was being filed, Prime Minister Stephen Harper signalled his government was delaying for as long as two years the release of long-promised regulations to reduce emissions from the booming oil-sands sector.\nThe report to the UN gives no indication of how Ottawa plans to meet a commitment Mr. Harper made at the Copenhagen summit in 2009 that Canada would reduce its emissions by 17 per cent from 2005 levels by 2020. Instead, it talks vaguely about new regulations in its \"sector-by-sector\" approach, while adding that provinces, businesses and consumers also have a responsibility to address climate change.\nIn contrast, U.S. President Barack Obama laid out a plan last summer \u2013 including regulations on new and existing coal-fired power plants \u2013 that would largely meet the U.S. 2020 commitment, which is the same as Canada's.\n\"We don't know yet whether the U.S. will hit its 2020 targets, but we do know they take it seriously and they're designing an approach that gives them a real shot at meeting the goal,\" P.J. Partington, director of federal policy for the Calgary-based Pembina Institute, said on Wednesday. \"Clearly, [Ottawa] is not making an attempt to show how we're going to get on track to meet the same target.\"\nThe documents show that, without further policy action, Canada's emissions would be 734 megatonnes by 2020, or 20 per cent higher than the target of 612 megatonnes.\nAs part of a UN-led effort to reach a global treaty by 2015, the federal government is expected this year to announce an emission-reduction target for 2030 that would be significantly lower than 2020 levels. Without new measures, the government forecasts emissions in 2030 would be 815 megatonnes, or 33 per cent higher than its current 2020 target. All countries that committed to reducing emissions file annual reports on their progress with the UN.\nA spokeswoman for Environment Canada said the government has made progress, but offered no commitment to meet 2020 targets. She said Ottawa will introduce regulations for oil and gas producers and other large industrial emitters and natural-gas-fired power plants.\n\"The government of Canada is committed to addressing GHG emissions while keeping the Canadian economy strong,\" Environment Canada's Jirina Vlk said in an e-mail. Its approach \"allows us to protect both our environment and our economy.\"\nU.S. environmental groups will doubtless seize on the Canadian projections to ratchet up pressure on Mr. Obama to reject TransCanada Corp.'s Keystone XL pipeline proposal. The President has said the project's impact on GHG emissions would be a key factor in his long-delayed decision.\nBacked by a State Department report, the Canadian government argued a decision on the pipeline will have no impact on emissions because the crude would find a way to market with or without it. That conclusion has been widely challenged and the U.S. administration has sent clear signals it wants progress on oil sands' emissions.\nWithout the climate regulations, the government forecasts that emissions from the oil and gas sector will soar by 23 per cent between 2005 and 2020, and by 48 per cent by 2030, swamping progress in other sectors. Fuelled by oil sands growth, Alberta's emissions are projected to increase by 40 per cent between 2005 and 2030, while Ontario, Quebec, Saskatchewan, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick would all see declines.\nIn its report, the federal government noted Canada has made progress, despite having one of the fastest growing populations in the developed world, among the best economic performances and a reliance on the resource sector. Its GHG emissions per capita are at the lowest level since tracking began in 1990, and while the economy has grown by 8.4 per cent since 2005, emissions have fallen by 4.8 per cent.\nWith a growing economy, meeting the 2020 target is \"challenging,\" Ottawa told the UN body."

More than 170 objectors have been jailed since the start of the intifada.\nThe case has become a cause celebre in Israel because Mr Netanyahu's wife, Sara, is Mr Ben-Artzi's aunt and it may set a legal precedent regarding an individual's right to be exempted from military service in Israel.\nMr Ben-Artzi's lawyers plan to plead for his release on the grounds that he is a conscientious objector and should be exempt from compulsory military duty.\nConscientious objectors have a status that is recognised in international laws signed by Israel. \"Because of my beliefs, my own country is going to imprison me, in defiance of international laws, basic moral values and fundamental human rights,\" Mr Ben-Artzi said in a statement to the Israeli Defence Force.\nHe said that he would be prepared to carry out alternative community service, such as teaching or helping the poor.\nAsked whether his uncle, a former combat soldier in an elite commando unit, approved of his stand, Mr Ben-Artzi said: \"He was prime minister and he knows that Israel is a democratic country.

Michael Sfard, a lawyer for Mr Ben-Artzi, said: \"The army in Israel is a prestigious club that is run by secular men.\n\"While the army can tolerate exempting certain people who do not belong in the elite - women, people with mental problems, drug takers and so on - this case is different.\n\"This guy is a general example of a secular, middle-class recruit from a good family.

But over the years several attempts to prove this had always proved futile.\nAfter more than 42 years of silence, Grezzju Vella, who was only 16 at the time, narrated the horrible day of this gruesome discovery.\nHe had been doing some work near the dome of the church, believed to be one of the earliest domes in Malta, together with his uncle, Carmelo Spiteri, and a fellow worker, \u010aikku Zammit.\nAt one point he got fed up and unwittingly began to scrape at a narrow crack between two stone slabs.\nWhen the crack widened, he threw a stone inside, expecting to hear it go down into the church, but instead it fell nearby and he realised that there was something underneath the roof.\nMr Vella called the others and soon they were joined by Fr Palmier, who was responsible for the church, and by \u0120anMar\u00ec Debono, who was the sacristan.\nOn the removal of a large stone, a dark void was revealed and since only Mr Vella could pass through the hole in the roof, he was tied to a rope and given a box of matches so that he could inspect the site.\nEventually the boy came upon a number of human skeletons and got a terrible fright which left him deeply traumatised.\nIn fact Mr Vella never returned to this church again, notwithstanding that he lives only a few kilometres away.\nIt was only last year that he bravely ventured into the passages and nervously took a look at the human bones, now stacked at the far corner of the third corridor.\nNo one knows who these bones belonged to and how they ended up in these secret passages. Again, speculation is rife.\nSome suggest that they were the unfortunate victims of the frightening Turkish attack which took place in 1614, while others suggest the place might have been used as an ossuary.\nBetween 1978 and 1980 some studies on the bones indicated that the skeletons had probably been exhumed and moved there from a cemetery. Moreover, it was found that these people had seemingly died within a short time of one another.\nUnfortunately today the procession of St Gregory has lost much of its appeal.\nIn fact, the route has been shortened considerably as it starts from the small chapel of St Clement which is situated in the limits of \u017bejtun and ends only a short distance away at St Gregory\u2019s church.\nAccording to \u017bejtun historian Canon Joe Abela, this tradition is yielding to the changes of time, turning from a covenant of faith into a mere celebration for the first swim in the cool waters of Marsaxlokk."

        "input": "Suburban Station becomes a refuge for homeless people during the cold weather. Many avoid shelters because of the rules.\nOn a frigid night in January, SEPTA police stepped among the dozens of people camped out in Suburban Station\u2019s long corridors and ordered them to leave the station. Outside it was 26",
        "output": "degrees.\nIt\u2019s a closing-time routine for officers, clearing out people, many of them homeless, who seek shelter in the transit hub. This time, though, the crowd protested. It was too cold, they argued, and their resistance escalated into a melee that SEPTA officers quelled with pepper spray and swinging batons.\nTwo Philly homeless students were denied an adequate education. Now, there are statewide ripples.\nTransit police didn\u2019t use force until they were under assault, said Thomas Nestel, SEPTA\u2019s police chief, and ultimately needed backup from Philadelphia police to quell what was described as a mini-riot. The incident has fed fear among the homeless and left advocates questioning whether officers should have been moving people out on a frigid night.\nSEPTA police clear Suburban Station\u2019s halls to ensure security and make space for cleaning crews, Nestel said. Typically, officers direct people who need shelter to a Department of Behavioral Health facility at 15th and Market Streets. The people in Suburban Station late at night say officers can be brusque, but a physical confrontation is an anomaly.\nAbout 12:30 a.m. on Jan. 15, when officers asked people sleeping on the station floor to leave, some became physical with officers, Nestel said.\nOne of the people involved said she argued with officers because of the cold.\nAt Suburban Station, Tracy Amador talks about being pepper-sprayed by transit police there in January.\nAbout 10 SEPTA officers responded, Nestel said, along with a number of Philadelphia police. Two people were charged, both accused of assaulting an officer. One faces charges of inciting a riot and vandalism \u2014 glass was broken in one of the station\u2019s doors. Amador and one of the men charged, Tysan Bostic, 38, have sought social services for homeless people, Scullion said.\nSEPTA police\u2019s internal affairs reviewed the incident, which included watching video, and concluded officers acted appropriately. Nestel has made no changes to department policy, though he said: \u201cIf I can come up with a better way to handle it, I\u2019m going to.\u201d SEPTA declined to share video, saying it was the subject of an ongoing investigation.\nAmador, who says she has been homeless since leaving her husband in 2016, described standing in front of the exit to the station near a post office to discourage people from leaving. \u201cPolice were cattling us through the door,\u201d she said.\nShe suffered a black eye and bruises on her body, said staffers from Project HOME who saw her the day after the incident. Amador said her teeth were also damaged. Nestel said his officers knew her because of medical problems she has had, and she was once escorted out, but not arrested, after being found in a construction zone.\nNo ambulances were called after the conflict, Nestel said. Officers experienced no serious injuries. Nestel stood by his officers\u2019 conduct, saying that \u201cno force is ever pretty\u201d but that his personnel have the right to protect themselves.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not running a Gestapo force that is beating people and throwing them out because they\u2019re poor, and we\u2019re not going to be,\u201d he said.\nSuburban Station has the highest concentration of officers in any of the city\u2019s transit hubs.\nThat January night was designated a code blue, which means temperatures were so low that additional resources were being made available by the city Office of Homeless Services. Philadelphia has about 5,700 people without permanent housing, but of those, fewer than 1,000 are living on the street. On such nights, Scullion said, the priority for social service agencies is helping people who are exposed to the elements. The organization would prefer police grant sanctuary to people in the station on cold nights, said Carol Thomas, Project HOME\u2019s director of homeless services.\nNestel said that isn\u2019t possible.\nPolice asked people that night if they wanted help finding shelter as they cleared the hallway, Nestel said, and people declined. Thomas said police have called her organization in the past, and it has sent a van for those people being removed. Police should have done that before the situation escalated, she said. No incidents were reported the next week, when temperatures plunged into single digits, a SEPTA spokesman said.\nPolice acknowledged many of the people lingering in the station late at night have mental-health conditions, and the department has cooperated with Project HOME to create a list of close to 70 people who are in urgent need of mental-health assistance, Scullion said. Half of SEPTA\u2019s 270 transit officers have received training to interact with people suffering from mental-health conditions. The department is working toward training all officers. They are also working with the city to assign behavioral health experts to the station.\nThe eruption of tensions came as police and social service agencies navigate the murky, ambiguous subculture that comes to the station long after rush-hour commuters are gone. Philadelphia has 12,000 beds available to assist people who are homeless, and in winter months about 2,900 of those are open to people in immediate need of a place to sleep. There are those who, due to addiction, mental illness, or preference, refuse to seek aid.\nHomeless people asleep in Suburban Station between 10 and midnight on a recent night.\nAmador said she doesn\u2019t receive welfare or food stamps, and won\u2019t use shelters. \u201cI would rather sleep in the street because I\u2019m free to do whatever I want to do,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing people who are dealing drugs and probably engaged in some other kinds of activities,\u201d said Eva Gladstein, deputy managing director of Health and Human Services.\nSuburban Station\u2019s corridors splay out from its cavernous central concourse like the legs of a spider, and scattered along them late at night are dozens of people.\nAbout 11 p.m. on a recent night, two huddled in the doorway of a closed shop. Across from them, another person sprawled facedown on the floor, the leaves from a self-rolled cigarette scattered beside him. One crew sat in a circle beneath the bright, harsh lights. Another slouched against a maintenance vehicle. A man nearby appeared on the verge of falling asleep on his feet. The air carried, echoing laughter and smoke with a spicy tang, likely K2, a synthetic marijuana that people in the station readily admit to using. People defecate and urinate on the floors.\nDuring much of the last year, the number of indigent people in the station had been declining, Scullion said, but a head count on a cold night in January recorded 200 homeless people there, roughly equivalent to the same time last year.\nSEPTA police face the twin pressures of being sensitive to a vulnerable population and keeping one of the city\u2019s busiest transit hubs clean and safe.\nSEPTA sought middle ground last year when it worked with Project HOME to create the Hub of Hope, an 11,000-square-foot facility in the station that provides an array of assistance. It\u2019s well used but closes at 7 p.m. And Scullion noted the people lying on Suburban Station\u2019s floors late at night might not be the same people who turn to Hub of Hope for help."

He\u2019s a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of legendary funk bassist/singer/songwriter Bootsy Collins, and in Asheville,",
        "output": "Freekbass was hanging out with another legend, the \u201cWizard of Woo\u201d Bernie Worrell of P-Funk. DJ Spooky was enlisted to take the place of DJ Logic but this seemed perfect, since he\u2019s the one who appeared in the Moog documentary along with Worrell. Every show is start to finish improv, all crazy funk with bass, electronic beats and keyboards--no matter who is playing the show.\nAre you enjoying Moogfest? Is there anyone you want to see?\nOh yeah, definitely. I want to actually see [DJ] Spooky\u2019s own set. I\u2019m also excited to see Dan Funk who is a Los Angeles DJ kind of musician and I love really where he\u2019s coming from, his whole headspace and what he\u2019s doing. So we\u2019re just trying to squeeze in as much on this Halloween as we can, you know?\nTell me about your Funktronic sound.\nWell we came up with that word. There\u2019s obviously the electronica music scene, which is huge, and then there\u2019s the jam band scene. So it\u2019s combining that--a lot of people have been using \"jamtronica\" for a little bit. But we\u2019re coming from the organic side, from a funk sensibility which is kind of where my roots are obviously. Bernie\u2019s roots, that needs not to be said, and then you mix the electronic in with it too. We started playing a few shows and a little catchphrase started catching on--\"funktronica--and I thought that\u2019s a pretty cool word. It seems to really match what we were doing.\nHeadtronics has only been out touring since April of 2010 so we\u2019re a fairly new band. It\u2019s a side project for everybody. DJ Logic and I were playing a festival together and he had me come up on a set and jam with him. Stephen Molitz, who\u2019s the keyboard player, was there too so he played and we just ended up jamming all the time. We thought, \"Let\u2019s go on the road with this\". It\u2019s always a logistical nightmare because all three of us have our own booking agents, managers, and stuff, so getting one week where everybody\u2019s scheduled isn't easy. That\u2019s kind of how Moogfest happened. Steve Molitz couldn\u2019t do it because he\u2019s out with his band called Particle so I know Bernie because of Bootsy, so I was like, \"Hey, Bernie could you come and do this?\" Logic had worked with Bootsy too, so then we had Headtronics with the Logic/Freekbass/Bernie version. When they called about Moogfest, we\u2019re like, \u201cThis is great!\u201d You know, of course, Bernie had to be involved with it being about Moog. So I called up and said \u201cHey Logic, guess what?\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cAh man, I\u2019m out in San Francisco playing a jazz festival out there\u201d. I\u2019m like \u201cAgh!\u201d So long story short, we found out Spooky was here and his beats are sort of in the same sensibility as Logic\u2019s are--it was the perfect storm.\nThe band as you said is a side project and it\u2019s also set up to have special guests, which is part of the jam sensibility with the funk thrown in. Talk about that structure--does it give you more freedom?\nI love it. All Headtronics shows are one hundred per cent improvised. Everybody\u2019s always like, \u201cCome see our show, it will be different tonight!\u201d And with us it\u2019s for real. Then--not to sound cornball--but in a way it\u2019s almost like the audience dictates what you do and how you move. Is a song going to be three minutes or is it going to be twenty? We could play one song for the whole hour set tonight, or we could play three ten-minute songs or whatever. That\u2019s what\u2019s kind of exciting about it. With my own band, I jump around and get a little crazy onstage but with this band I\u2019m a little more centered. But I\u2019ll tell you, I\u2019m worn out after a Headtronics show. In a good way though, because you\u2019re always having to almost think one step ahead the whole time. I love it, because it\u2019s very challenging. I can also start bringing a lot of those sensibilities to in my own band and other projects--it keeps all that fresh as well. It\u2019s just a great thing.\nWe started Headtronics to do a show here and a show there. Now we\u2019re starting to do shows more and more regularly, and it\u2019s getting more exciting because the band\u2019s getting bigger. With all these different players we have coming in, it\u2019s almost like the Rhythm Devils where it\u2019s Mickey Hart\u2019s project with Bill Kreutzmann from the Dead and then they have a cast of characters that change. It\u2019s a different dynamic each time you go see the band live. And by default Headtronics is essentially me, DJ Logic, and Steve Molitz; that\u2019s the crux of the band. But we can do different variations of it--as long as it keeps in that funktronica sensibility.\nDo you see a CD or a recording on the road?\nFor sure, definitely. Like I said, the show\u2019s all improvised but when you play with the same players you remember that one little idea you had, so certain ideas start creeping into every show. So we\u2019re starting to kind of get certain songs that are kind of quote-unquote songs. In the studio, the one thing Logic and I are talking about is when we do record a CD, we want to try to duplicate what we do on stage. Whether doing an actual live CD, which we haven\u2019t really decided on, or if we do it in the studio, it should sound the same where Logic will start a beat and I\u2019ll do my bass line and Steve or Bernie or whoever\u2019s doing keyboards will add their craziness on top. It needs to really capture that.\nHave you always played the bass and how did you pick it up?\nWell, I started off as a drummer. So I was a drummer for a long time; it\u2019s kind of my approach even to the bass. Then I moved over to guitar until I saw a bass player and I thought how it\u2019s the best of both worlds! It\u2019s like a drum you can play notes with! I started playing drums when I was about ten or eleven and then picked up bass around fourteen. I still play a lot of drums and guitar, plus a little bit of keyboards and stuff. But bass is definitely my instrument--I mean with a name like Freekbass, it\u2019s got to be bass. It would be kind of silly if I played guitar, now wouldn\u2019t it?\nTell me about your signature bass\u2013how did that come about?\nThe bass itself is what it is called a \u201cone two three up.\u201d The neck is a one and if you can see, it goes into a two and then a three pointing straight up. We actually used to use that symbol, not as a bass necessarily, but on our posters when we first kind of started playing shows. We were playing a show down in Mississippi; I think it was there, where we met this guitar [maker] Luther. He\u2019d done guitar for a couple of guys in Train and did one of Yoakum\u2019s guitars and he was at a show where we were hanging out after the show talking about the symbol we used on our posters. He said how we should make that symbol into a bass. I told him that would look pretty wicked, could you do it? I\u2019ve got three CDs out and for each CD I\u2019ve got a bass \u201cone two three\u201d. So the one on my stage I\u2019m playing tonight is my second one, that\u2019s actually on Junkyard Waltz.\nAnd what about the custom amp?\nYeah, I have an endorsement with this company called Kustom and they were doing this line called Groove Bass Amp. When they launched the amp, they got in touch with me and asked me if I wanted to be an endorser for it, be the crazy cat that would be the guy to help sell it or whatever. I use a ton of effects and sometimes I\u2019m playing higher stuff, sometimes I\u2019m playing lower traditional bass stuff. Not to sound too music techie, but the nice thing about the rig is that it\u2019s got a ton of low end and you also get a lot of definition. It seems in a lot of amps I\u2019ve played in the past, you had to sacrifice one or the other. You could get an amp with a nice warm sound on the bottom but as soon as the rest of the band came in, you kind of lost all your definition. Or the opposite would happen, where you\u2019d have all this nice definition but it would be all \u201cclackity clackity\u201d. The really nice thing I liked when they got in touch with me was it was an honest thing. It has so many EQ options you know, graphic EQ and parametric EQ. It\u2019s got a ton of power--I think the amp is like 1300 watts. Now I don\u2019t use that much power, but a lot of times with the bass it\u2019s not so much that you have that much power so that you can turn it up loud; it\u2019s more about being able to push air. And that\u2019s the thing--so the amp can really handle that. So it worked out great and it\u2019s still being produced.\nYou\u2019ve been a big part of the Cinci music scene for years and recognized as such. For someone who\u2019s never been there--what\u2019s the scene like and is there anyone we should know about?\nFirst off, the scene itself is weird because it\u2019s a very conservative city. Cincinnati is very, very conservative and segregated, too, in a lot of ways. Now you get inside the city center and it's obviously real hip but anywhere in the suburbs is very conservative. But every generation has some kind of funk thing that comes out of there. King records started there in the '60s. James Brown recorded all his hits there--every big James Brown record was recorded in Cincinnati at King Records. They just put a plaque up and they\u2019re working on turning the studio into a museum. So that\u2019s how Bootsy got discovered because he was playing in the studio when James was there when he fired his band or something. James was like \u201cHey, come over here!\u201d And then the next thing you know Bootsy was jamming. It was that kind of story. So you had James Brown in the '60s and early '70s, then Bootsy in the late '70s/early '80s.\nThere\u2019s a twin city called Dayton, which is 40 minutes up the road, and there\u2019s that group called the Ohio Players. Babyface is a big R&B producer and he was in a band called the Deele which was out of Cincinnati. There\u2019s also a label called La Face Records which is home to Pink and TLC--they\u2019re now out of Atlanta. Actually, Bootsy is the one who gave Babyface his nickname too. So it didn\u2019t matter if you were out of the suburbs or the inner city, there was so much rhythmic music there. Ironically there\u2019s a huge bluegrass scene too. Cincinnati is on the border of Northern Kentucky so it\u2019s kind of a Minneapolis/St Paul kind of scenario. My theory is even though you might think that funk and bluegrass are so different, think about how rhythmic the two music styles are. You\u2019ve got this rural area of Kentucky right next to urban Cincinnati, so you\u2019ve got this hodgepodge of rhythm and sounds. Now in terms of current bands coming out of the area, in the '90s there was a band called the Afghan Whigs who were a pretty big group in the whole Seattle Sub Pop scene. And there\u2019s a new band called Heartless Bastards with a gal named Erica who has an amazing voice. She actually moved to Austin recently but they grew out of Cincinnati music scene.\nDid you grow up there?\nYeah, and that\u2019s actually how I met Bootsy. One of his singers was a guy named Mudbone. Mudbone had his own group called Sly Fox and they had a big hit called \u201cLet's Go All The Way\u201d. In the mid to late '90s he was trying to put the band back together again and he was doing demo stuff. I was playing in some bands around Cincinnati at the time, and he had me do some demo stuff with him. He said there was a label out of Japan called P-Vine Records. P-Vine Records was doing this Jimi Hendrix tribute record where they had all these funk and soul artists do songs about Jimi Hendrix. Mudbone was doing a song with Bootsy producing and engineering it, so he said, \"Why don\u2019t you come out to Bootsy\u2019s?\" and of course I was like \u201cWhaaa!\u201d And that\u2019s how we met and we really hit it off, so we started writing songs together. Originally when the whole Freekbass thing started, it was going to be more of a studio project. I thought, \"Well, this material sounds pretty cool, so it would be cool to go do some shows\". And a couple shows led to a couple more ,and the next thing I know I\u2019m on the road with an agent. That\u2019s kind of the very, very abridged story.\nIs there an AKA, can we know what your real name is?\nI think my mom even slips every once in a while and calls me Freekbass. My real name is Chris Sherman--my Clark Kent alias, I guess."

Despite being some 6,970 feet above sea level, it feels like the basement of the world, wide and flat and under the massive Southwestern sky. Driving to the Observatory, the home of the famous \"Very Large Array\" of radio telescopes, is an exercise in patience. The repetitive landscape unfolds past the car windows at 80 miles an hour (the speed limit is 65, a Dadaist joke that no one seems to adhere to); with every rise you crest, you half-expect the fantastic vista to suddenly reveal itself, a sea of telescopes casting shadows on the parched Earth. For an hour, it doesn't.\nThe scale of the desert plays with your sense of perspective as you pull up into parking lot abutting the visitor's center, a shoddy-looking building flanked by porta-potties. The dishes, which looked reasonable from the highway four miles away, seem actually preposterous from up close. They are huge. Blanched white, they all point in exactly the same direction: up.* Each dish is only a part of the larger system, and their synchronized operation is part of both their visual appeal and their usefulness to scientists. Whether scrunched together or arranged widely across the basin -- an effect not unlike a camera focusing and unfocusing -- together they can peer into the distant cosmos.\nA hot desert wind blows everything not bolted down away. The displays in the Very Large Array's little on-site museum seem to be five years, maybe a decade, behind the times: one panel excitedly compares the storage capacity of the control center's magnetic tape to \"a floppy disc on your PC.\" Outside of the visitor's center, a wind-and-sand-ravaged sign warns of poisonous snakes. This is the Wild West of astronomy.\nLeaflets and poster boards at the VLA visitor's center repeatedly emphasize that these telescopes are not exclusively used for SETI research. \"We don't look for little green men,\" the literature sneers. Still, telescope time has been lent out for SETI efforts occasionally -- most notably to double-check the \"WOW!\" signal in the mid-1990s. Thanks to the new Allen Telescope Array in Northern California, however, SETI won't need to poke around New Mexico for telescope access much longer: they'll have a large-scale telescope fully at their disposal (the SETI project there, once completed, will be able \"see\" transmissions from 1,000 light years away).\nThe Very Large Array self-guided walking tour is a half-mile loop peppered with chatty placards and bugs the size of oranges. At one stop, two white \"whisper dishes\" display the focusing properties of a parabolic dish, a classic kid's science trick. Further along, you can peek at the visiting scientists' quarters -- double-wides, basically -- and inspect the railway tracks by which the telescopes, with a special lifting locomotive, are picked up and moved to their various configurations, allowing \"aperture synthesis interferometry with a maximum baseline of 22.3 miles.\" Everything else, including almost all of the antennae, is off limits, whichis fine -- it looks fantastic from a distance anyway.\n*At least when I was there. Signs below the pedestrian-accessible 'scope indicated that the dishes might suddenly swivel all at once to follow some astronomical object, like rubber-necking spectators at Wimbledon. I was not privy to such a sight.\nThis is excellent, thank you. I just love radio astronomy and wish I could understand the complex math that is necessary. That is needed to understand the books properly about the subject. I would love to visit the VLA. I was wondering if you can stay there, like they allow people to do at Parkes in Australia.\nIn the 5th paragraph you said that SETI won't have to poke around Arizona for telescope access anymore... did you mean New Mexico?\nWHOOPS.

        "output": "Senate Foreign Relations Committee and longtime proponent of sanctions on Iran\u2019s nuclear program who has clashed with the Obama administration on this issue in the past, said that the agreement as negotiated \u201cfailed to achieve the one thing it set out to achieve\u2014it failed to stop Iran from becoming a nuclear weapons state at a time of its choosing.\u201d Menendez said his \u201coverarching concern is that it requires no dismantling of Iran\u2019s nuclear infrastructure and only mothballs that infrastructure for 10 years\u201d and recommits Iran to agreements, such as the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, that it has violated in the past.\nThe hawkish senator is now publicly opposed to the White House\u2019s two signature foreign policy moves of the past year: the Iran deal and the normalizing of diplomatic relations with Cuba, a move the Cuban-American Menendez says \u201cstinks.\u201d He joins New York\u2019s Chuck Schumer as well as the entire Republican caucus in opposing the Iran deal. A vote for a motion disapproving of the agreement, which Obama has said he will veto, is likely in September. The next big question mark is Menendez\u2019s New Jersey counterpart Cory Booker, who is still undecided and is being heavily lobbied by both the White House and the pro-Israel groups that donated more to his campaign than any other Democrat in the last election cycle.\nEven with heavy lobbying on both sides, Obama\u2019s veto of the agreement is still likely to stand. About 30 of the 34 senators needed to uphold a presidential veto are already on board, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi says she is optimistic she can keep most of her caucus together despite some notable defections. The fact that the veto is likely to stand may actually make it easier for Iran hawks like Menendez and Schumer to oppose the White House.\nNevertheless, there\u2019s already some speculation about how the White House could proceed if Obama\u2019s veto were overridden. The AP\u2019s Deb Riechmann noted Monday that though he would undoubtedly face heavy criticism, Obama could still lift most of the sanctions imposed on Iran through executive order, and Europe and the U.N. could lift others. Still, some of the toughest sanctions, including measures orchestrated in large part by Menendez, were imposed by Congress, and Iran could interpret a decision not to lift these as the U.S. violating its commitments under the agreement, something hardliners, including the country\u2019s supreme leader, have warned of. This would probably make Iran less likely to comply with the terms of the deal. The warning from Washington\u2019s hawks that Iran can\u2019t be trusted to halt its nuclear program could turn out to be self-fulfilling.\nUpdate, 5:15 p.m. Following Menendez\u2019s announcement, Rhode Island senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse announced their support for the deal."

Based on Pat Conroy's memoir, \"The Water is Wide,\" the movie portrayed the challenges of a young, white schoolteacher, played by Jon Voight, who volunteered in 1969",
        "output": "to teach in a two-room, all-black school on \"Yamacraw Island,\" the fictional name given Daufuskie Island, now highly developed with golf courses, a residential club, vacation homes and docks for private yachts.\nBy chance, I saw the movie recently on a cable channel and found it as moving and provocative now as it was then. This viewing prompted me to read Conroy's memoir. Sadly, the movie is not available in a DVD format compatible with U.S. players.\nIn \"The Water in Wide,\" Conroy, fired with reformist zeal, gave up his job as a high school teacher in Beaufort, S.C., to move to Yamacraw Island, inhabited predominately by impoverished African-American families, many of whom spoke a distinctive Gullah dialect. A once-prosperous oyster industry had collapsed several years earlier after a chemical plant polluted the beds, leaving the residents in a subsistence economy.\nConroy's class included children of middle-school age. Several students could not read; a few could not count to 10. The school system dictated strict adherence to a curriculum devoted to drilling \"basics\" into brains of students. The school's principal repeatedly chided students on their lack of learning and liberally used a leather belt to enforce discipline. The district superintendent was committed to the status quo, which meant keeping the students in their place. The twosome tried to block every innovation utilized by Conroy.\nSeeing the futility of the standard curriculum, Conroy used other means to capture his students' attention. Finding a movie projector, he showed movies to stimulate discussion. A phonograph and tape recorder found in a dusty closet provided opportunities for music and creative narratives composed by students. Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, supplemented by Conroy's introduction that the opening chords represented \"death knocking on your door,\" was a student favorite. Useless, outdated textbooks remained unopened in desks as Conroy developed other pathways to thinking in a deeply superstitious culture.\nMost of the students had never left the island, which had neither bridge nor ferry service. The water and marshland assured the physical and cultural isolation of the residents. Conroy arranged an overnight trip to Beaufort so his students could for the first time celebrate Halloween with costumes and trick-or-trick forays into predominantly white neighborhoods.\nIn the spring, Conroy took his class to Washington, D.C., traipsing to the Smithsonian National Gallery, Lincoln Memorial and Washington Monument and the National Zoo, which was the biggest hit for the students. After the spring term, he took a smaller group of students to a retreat on the mainland, where he taught the boys how to swim; he could never overcome the girls' fear of water. Before each excursion, Conroy had to overcome qualms of parents and objections of the principal and superintendent.\nWhen the superintendent fired him for insubordination and other trumped-up charges at the end of the school year, Conroy appealed to the school board, which rejected the action.\nAt the beginning of his second year on the island, Conroy was again dismissed. Parents and students staged a boycott. The superintendent threatened jail and fines for protesters. Conroy urged an end to the protest and retired to the mainland to write his memoir. Other memorable books followed in his distinguished career. He died earlier this year.\nWould a Pat Conroy be tolerated in failing schools today?\nChildren of all races and ethnicities can be as isolated today in urban housing projects, impoverished neighborhoods and collapsing towns as the children of Yamacraw Island in the 1960s. Poverty and inadequate education create invisible barriers for children to participate in the opportunities enjoyed by so many in thriving communities. In a two-tiered, public education system, poorer schools lack books for their libraries, internet access and adequate counseling for the complex problems of students. A child's postal ZIP code should not determine his opportunities in life.\nPoor rates for graduation and readiness for post-high school education suggest that standard curricula should be rethought. A single approach to instruction may not fit every school. The challenge is to find a formula that will reach every child and set him or her on a pathway to lifelong learning.\nRead \"The Water is Wide.\" It presents a challenge for all us.\nContact Clif Cleaveland at ccleaveland@timesfree press.com."

        "output": "Medicare more times than we can count. (For a sample, look here, here and here.) It\u2019s popped up again in this year\u2019s Senate race in Kentucky.\nDemocrat Alison Lundergan Grimes recently accused incumbent Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of supporting a $6,000 per year increase in Medicare costs for beneficiaries -- another once-popular claim resurfacing. We\u2019ve rated that False.\nThe McConnell campaign swiftly retaliated with an ad of its own the next day.\n\"The truth? Grimes supports Obamacare, which cuts $700 billion from seniors\u2019 Medicare. That\u2019s how Obama and Grimes will pay for Obamacare,\" the ad says.\nFor old times\u2019 sake, we decided to look into the claim once again.\nThe Affordable Care Act is projected to reduce federal spending on Medicare by about $716 billion between 2013 and 2022, but it does not literally cut funding from the program or reduce its overall budget.\nIn fact, spending will continue to increase for the foreseeable future. The Affordable Care Act just slows its growth, instituting a number of changes to try to bring down future health care costs in the program.\nThe spending reductions fall largely on insurance companies and hospitals, not seniors. The law made significant reductions to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. The program, started under President George W. Bush, has cost more than expected -- and more than traditional Medicare.\nHospitals will also be paid less if they have too many readmissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care.\nAlso, the $716 billion in reductions is not really being used to \"pay for\" the law, as McConnell said. At the time the health care law was being finalized, Democrats said it was important to them that the new law not add to federal budget deficits. So the reductions in Medicare spending were counted against the health care law\u2019s new spending over a period of about 10 years.\nSome of the new spending is within the Medicare program, such as increasing coverage for prescription drugs and offering preventive care with no out-of-pocket costs.\nDoes Grimes support the Affordable Care Act?\nWhen the law was enacted in 2010, Grimes was working as an attorney in Lexington, Ky., and played no role in the Affordable Care Act debate. But she hasn\u2019t been able to avoid questions about her stance on the law this election cycle.\nSince the start of her campaign, Grimes has said she is troubled by certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. She has also said the solution is to improve on the law, rather than to throw it out completely. She\u2019s spoken positively of 640,000 Kentuckians who were previously uninsured and will now be able to get insurance.\nIt\u2019s a bit harder to pin down her position on the Medicare spending reductions specifically.\nAt the 2013 Kentucky State Fair, a reporter from the Louisville television station WHAS 11 asked Grimes if she agreed with Republicans that the Affordable Care Act would hurt senior citizens.\n\"I\u2019m troubled with certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act,\" she said. \"But we're here at the State Fair, and if there's three reasons why Kentuckians, especially our seniors, need access to affordable health care coverage, you just have to look over to the right where you see the donut burger, the chili cheese steak and the covered French fries.\"\nAn ad out of the McConnell campaign said, \"Grimes supports Obamacare, which cuts $700 billion from seniors\u2019 Medicare.\"\nGrimes has been cautiously supportive of the Affordable Care Act, and she certainly does not oppose it as strongly as McConnell does. The law is projected to reduce spending on Medicare by about $700 billion over 10 years, but those reductions in spending are more of a slowed growth rate rather than a budget cut.\nPublished: Thursday, July 10th, 2014 at 4:14 p.m."

In fact, many were stunned. And in a fast-growing economy with a large informal sector in which it\u2019s estimated that around 90 percent of transactions take place using cash, trashing most of the cash in circulation was not unlike throwing sand into the gears of a machine running at full speed. Furthermore, because hundreds of millions of Indians lack formal bank accounts, the impact was felt most by the poorest. The gender impact was also uneven, given that 80 percent of women in India are unbanked, according to the UN.\nLong lines at banks and ATMs quickly became commonplace, generating what the BBC reported as widespread chaos. One laborer noted, \u201cit was like someone had picked my pocket\u201d as vendors refused to accept his currency. It\u2019s estimated that at least 70 people have died as a result of the demonetization. Overworked bank officials, as well as those denied medical services because of inappropriate currency denominations, are among the dead. \u201cDay of Rage\u201d protests erupted across the country, and as they did, the terms of the demonetization changed on an almost daily basis, leading to even greater confusion and uncertainty.\nAs a result, economic activity in India is plunging. According to the Wall Street Journal, home sales are stagnant, political discussion about the scheme has brought the Indian parliament to a standstill, and tourists are paralyzed by the inability to use the Indian currency in their possession. The cash crunch is also rippling through supply chains, leading manufacturers to cut jobs, lower production and reduce demand for raw materials. Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has suggested India will suffer a drop in GDP of around 2 percent as a result of Modi\u2019s \u201cmonumental mismanagement\u201d of the demonetization effort.\nSo what was Modi thinking? He noted his primary objective was \u201cto break the grip of corruption and black money.\u201d Modi further stated, \u201cblack money and corruption are the biggest obstacles in eradicating poverty.\u201d Indians hoarding bills would be forced to deposit or exchange them, allowing tax authorities to delve deeper into the sources of such funds. More tax revenues might lead to greater social spending and government support.\nIndians hoarding bills would be forced to deposit or exchange them, allowing tax authorities to delve deeper into the sources of such funds. More tax revenues might lead to greater social spending and government support.\nTo prevent fraud during the exchange process, the government imposed limits on the amount of currency that could be swapped by any individual. To keep track of the limits, banks began to mark the left index finger of those who had exchanged old notes for new ones with permanent ink. But because this is the same method used to prevent election fraud, the Election Commission noted the marks might disenfranchise voters in ongoing local elections.\nAnother related goal of the effort, Modi noted, was to nudge the country towards \u201cthe realization of our dream of a cashless society.\u201d According to research commissioned by MasterCard, India has one of the highest cash-to-GDP ratios in the world at around 12 percent, meaningfully above China (9.5 percent), the United States (7.5 percent), Mexico (5.3 percent), Brazil (3.9 percent), and South Africa (3.7 percent), but well below that of Japan (20.7 percent). Heading towards a cashless society would increase India\u2019s effectiveness in monitoring tax compliance, tracking terrorist financing and of course spotting financial crime and corruption.\nCritics suggest that such efforts are ineffective at truly stopping large-scale corruption however. Arun Kumar, author of the \u201cThe Black Economy in India,\u201d estimates that only 1 to 2 percent of illicit wealth is stored in cash. Most, he notes, is stored in gold, in property or in Swiss bank accounts. Further, Kumar notes that demonetization does not address the mechanisms or flow of dirty money \u2014 it only attempts to address the stock of prior gains from corruption. To truly target corruption, many believe essential policies include institutional reforms strengthening the rule of law, better law enforcement and public awareness campaigns.\nNevertheless, arguments from academics to trash cash keep building. \u201cThe Curse of Cash,\u201d a recent book by Kenneth Rogoff, supports the claim that a large portion of high-denomination paper currency is used to enable tax evasion, finance terrorist operations and support underground economies in illegal drugs and human trafficking. (Rogoff wants to phase out the U.S. $100 bill.) A paper by Peter Sands, a senior fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School, also recommended eliminating high-denomination notes to deter these activities. And Larry Summers, former U.S. Treasury Secretary, has called for a global agreement to stop issuing notes worth more than $50 or $100.\nWe should of course insist on improved compliance and enforcement of a strong rule of law. But we should not dismiss trashing cash as a potentially useful tool to nudge better behavior.\nTo understand how these decisions might impact those transporting large sums of money in cash, consider the weight of U.S. $10 million in various currency denominations. A criminal carrying such a sum in U.S. $20 bills would need to lug 500 kg (more than 1,000 pounds!) of paper notes. In U.S. $100 bills, the weight would drop by 80 percent to 100 kg, about the weight of a large man. If using 500-euro notes, a criminal would only have to carry slightly over 20 kg. And using the Swiss 1,000-franc notes could reduce the burden to a mere 11 kg.\nIn a highly dynamic and uncertain global economy, there will always be nefarious actors trying to operate in the shadows. One way of targeting illicit activities is to increase the frictional costs of such doings by eliminating high-denomination notes. And although such efforts admittedly focus on symptoms more than the root causes of corruption, there is little downside in pursuing such an approach. We should of course insist on improved compliance and enforcement of a strong rule of law. But we should not dismiss trashing cash as a potentially useful tool to nudge better behavior."

Not even a year ago, consensus thinking saw China\u2019s yuan on the verge of replacing the dollar as the world\u2019s premier reserve currency. Now the flood of funds out",
        "output": "of China, and the yuan\u2019s declining value, have stifled all such talk and even such thinking. No doubt circumstances will continue along current lines for a while to come. Still, today\u2019s negative attitudes are setting the stage for a rebirth of pro-yuan speculation, perhaps pretty soon. It will be wrong again.\nWhen the pro-yuan thinking was at its height last spring, it looked as though the currency had support from all quarters. China\u2019s economy seemed to be doing reasonably well, though growing at a much slower pace than previously. Beijing was also making headlines with its efforts to give the yuan a more prominent international role. To argue the other side of the question, that the dollar was not quite so vulnerable, took a disciplined analysis of the fundamentals, historic and economic, as well as recognition that not all policy in Beijing supported the effort to substitute the yuan for the dollar. The National Interest offered just such an analysis.\nThe pro-yuan enthusiasm, nonetheless, dominated most decision making. Foreign companies, confident China was unstoppable and that the yuan\u2019s value would continue to rise, invested heavily in the country. For the same reasons, foreigners bought Chinese stocks and bonds, while Chinese firms borrowed in dollars and other foreign currencies with the expectation that their appreciating yuan earnings would enable them to service this debt easily. All these huge capital inflows created an exaggerated feeling of prosperity in the Chinese economy and drove up the prices of Chinese stocks and other financial assets, a development that redoubled the supportive inflows.\nBut because the extremes of enthusiasm were without fundamental foundation, the situation became increasingly fragile. Two small changes were enough to bring it down. First, the pace of Chinese growth slowed. It was at base a matter of no great concern, a natural response to a more mature phase of development, as articles in the National Interest explained. But even though China\u2019s growth continued strong by the standards of just about any other economy on earth, so much was riding on continued impressive Chinese gains that even this modest and predictable adjustment unnerved business people and investors alike. Second, it became apparent that the financial liberalization necessary to make the yuan an international currency would have an immediate adverse effect, as Chinese investors, who previously could not get their assets out of the country, looked to the liberalizing trend as a way to buy overseas and thereby diversify their holdings. This eagerness to leave was less a lack of confidence in China than simply a prudent way to minimize the risk of having everything in one place and one currency. But it nonetheless fostered uneasy feelings.\nSo what should have been a minor adjustment turned the overheated environment into a rout. Money flowed out of stocks and other financial assets. According to Chinese government statistics, foreign investors in Chinese stocks and bonds sold the equivalent of some $17 billion during the third quarter, the most recent period for which complete data are available. It was a radical shift indeed from the $16 billion in purchases they made during the second quarter. The Shanghai Exchange has, as a result, declined almost 50 percent from its peaks last June. So, too, the direct foreign investments into Chinese businesses slowed markedly. While new direct investment flows registered only the equivalent of $39 billion during the third quarter of 2015, down a bit less than half from the $71 billion recorded in the second quarter, foreign firms already in China pulled the equivalent of some $32 billion out of the country. More recent, if more tentative, data suggests that both these patterns have continued so that, for all of 2015, net capital outflows appear to have verged on $1 trillion.\nWith so much money flowing abroad, it is little wonder that the yuan has come under considerable downward pressure. China\u2019s central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC), tried at first to support the yuan\u2019s price, buying actively with its ample hoard of foreign exchange reserves. For a while it succeeded, but between August and September it allowed the yuan to depreciate 3.7 percent against the dollar; it depreciated another 1.5 percent by year\u2019s end and another 1.0 percent or more so far this year, for a total depreciation of about 6.5 percent\u2014a big move for the yuan. This decline in the currency\u2019s value no doubt contributed to the intensification of the outflows during the latter months of 2015 and into this year.\nFor the time being, this negative pattern will likely persist. But just as the past enthusiasms planted the seeds of today\u2019s problems, so too are today\u2019s ugly sentiments planting the seeds of another, more positive change. By delaying some of the planned financial liberalizations, Beijing has begun to relieve some fear of that source of capital flight. At the same time, the yuan\u2019s depreciation has begun to make the pricing of Chinese products more attractive to global markets. Returning an export edge that once seemed gone forever may delay some of the fundamental adjustments Beijing had planned for the economy, but it will also prompt marginally faster growth.\nIn time, these unfolding changes will make investors regain a measure of confidence and rethink their present negative consensus, though likely not as dramatically as they reversed their once positive consensus of last spring. China will have weathered a crisis that many feared would destroy it, allowing people again to see the positive prospects for what is, after all, a large economy with considerable development potential. If in that more sober context Beijing returns to its planned liberalizations, as is likely, any diversification by Chinese investors will look a lot less frightening than it did in the face of the earlier enthusiasms. Given sufficient time, this new, more positive mood will renew speculation that the yuan can replace the dollar as the world\u2019s premier currency. Then, the National Interest will have to update its earlier fundamental currency analysis.\nMr. Ezrati is a contributing editor at the National Interest, an affiliate of the Center for the Study of Human Capital at the University at Buffalo (SUNY) and recently retired as Lord, Abbett & Co.\u2019s senior economist and market strategist.

It\u2019s important to approach the topics with which people are already engaged, she said. For example, what kind of wood is used in baseball bats \u2013 and are those species endangered?"

Scientists had found",
        "output": "planets in these binary systems, so-called circumbinary planets with two suns like Tatooine in the \"Star Wars\" universe.\nTo find more circumbinary planets, astronomers analyzed data from NASA's prolific Kepler space telescope, which has detected more than 2,300 potential alien worlds since its March 2009 launch. Kepler had to date detected four systems with circumbinary planets \u2014 Kepler-16, 34, 35 and 38.\n\"Kepler-47 shows us that binary stars can have close-in planetary systems, just like the ones we see in single stars,\" study lead author Jerome Orosz at San Diego State University told SPACE.com. \"Most of the stars in the galaxy are in binary or higher-order multiple systems, so the fact that planetary systems can exist in these types of systems is important. If we were restricted to looking for planets around single stars, we would be missing most of the stars in the galaxy.\"\nThe planets are much too far away to see with the naked eye. Rather, they were discovered by the drop in brightness they cause when they cross in front of, or transit, their host stars.\nThis dimming is tiny, only 0.08 percent for planet Kepler-47b and 0.2 percent for planet Kepler-47c. By comparison, Venus blocked about 0.1 percent of the sun's surface during its recent transit. Data from Kepler enabled researchers to deduce the relative sizes of the objects and orbits. They also relied on follow-up observations performed by telescopes at the McDonald Observatory in West Texas.\nThe inner world completes an orbit every 49.5 days, while the outer one takes 303.2 days, giving it the largest known orbit for any transiting exoplanet. The stars themselves whirl around each other every 7.5 days.\nThe scientists published their findings online Aug. 28 in the journal Science. They will also detail their results Aug. 29 at the General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union in Beijing.\nThis illustration shows the orbits of the two alien planets circling two stars of Kepler-47, and the orbits of our own solar system planets for comparison.\nPlanet in the habitable zone?\nIntriguingly, the outer planet lurks in the system's habitable zone, where a rocky planet like Earth is the right temperature to have liquid water on its surface.\n\"We've learned that circumbinary planets can be like the planets in our own solar system, but with two suns,\" said study co-author Joshua Carter at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.\nAlthough the outer planet is probably a gas giant slightly larger than Uranus and therefore not suitable for life as we know it, these findings do show that circumbinary planets can and do exist in habitable zones.\n\"The thing I find most exciting is the potential for habitability in a circumbinary system,\" said study co-author William Welsh at San Diego State University. \"Kepler-47c is not likely to harbor life, but if it had large moons, those would be very interesting worlds.\"\nThis artist's illustration shows a comparison of the two alien planets discovered to orbit twin stars in the Kepler-47 system. The smaller planet is up to 4.6 times the Earth's diameter. The larger world is likely slightly larger than Uranus.\nCircumbinary planets might undergo relatively wild climate swings.\nOn Earth, the sun is a relatively stable source of light, with the solar insolation or energy we receive only varying by 0.1 percent or so. \"As a result, we don't need to worry about what the sun is doing, at least over time-scales of years to decades,\" Orosz said. \"For a planet around a binary system, there can be changes in the insolation of several percent on the time-scale of days to weeks. In addition, if the planet's rotation axis is tilted, then that also has an effect. Therefore the seasons are rapid and complicated.\"\n\"Also, let's say for the sake of discussion that the planet's rotation period is 24 hours, just like the Earth,\" he added. \"Because you have two suns instead of one, you can have more than 12 hours of daylight, depending on the positions of the stars at sunrise or sunset.\"\nIn addition, since all the circumbinary planets the Kepler space telescope has discovered have orbits closely aligned with the orbits their stars have with each other, \"you would see your suns eclipse each other on a regular basis,\" Orosz said. \"In the case of Kepler-47, when the secondary star passes in front of the primary, the total light drops by 15 percent. This would happen every 7.5 days or so.\"\nThe new discovery show that planetary systems can form and survive even in the chaotic environment around binary stars.\nThe researchers expect that the planets in Kepler-47 originated much farther out than their present orbits, at locations where the conditions for the formation of giant planets are more favorable. They eventually then migrated inward due to interactions with the disk of gas and dust that also encircled the stars.\n\"We think these planets and most other planets formed from a residual disk of debris left over from the star-formation process,\" Orosz said. \"It was not at all obvious that this disk could survive near a newly formed binary star, given the orbital motions of the two stars. However, it now appears that apart from minor differences in the orbital spacings, planetary systems around binary stars can be similar to those around single stars.\"\nIn the future, the researchers want to look for smaller and smaller alien planets around binary stars.\n\"We are at the limit of what simple visual searches can do, so we need better software to help us automate the process,\" Orosz said. \"Given more time and data, I think we can find more circumbinary planetary systems in the Kepler data.\""

        "output": "said Chipzilla has no evidence that the processor flaws \u2013 successfully demonstrated by security researchers \u2013 had been exploited by malicious hackers and advised businesses and consumers alike to apply security patches.\n\"As of now, we have not received any information that these exploits have been used to obtain customer data,\" Krzanich said. \"And we are working tirelessly on these issues to ensure it stays that way. The best thing you can do to make sure your data remains safe is to apply any updates from your operating system vendor and system manufacturer as soon as they become available.\"\nKrzanich went on to promise fixes for the majority of Intel CPUs within a week, with the rest to follow by the end of January.\n\"We believe the performance impact of these updates is highly workload-dependent,\" he said. \"As a result, we expect some workloads may have a larger impact than others, so we will continue working with the industry to minimise the impact on those workloads over time.\"\nIntel's admission follows public statements by other IT heavyweights that applying the Spectre and Meltdown patches incurs a price. Red Hat has spoken of a performance hit of between one to 20 per cent, while Google has spoken about \"minimal performance impact\".\nImpacts are workload-dependent with Amazon customers, among others, already seeing the effects of patching, as previously reported.\nThe reduced horsepower effects are mainly the consequence of Meltdown patches, which on Linux apply separation between the kernel and user virtual memory address spaces through a technology called Kernel Page Table Isolation, or KPTI.\nMeltdown and Spectre have shaken the IT industry to its core since they were exposed by The Register last week.\nMeltdown creates a means for user applications to read kernel memory and is limited to Intel processors (and the Arm Cortex-A75). Radical patches for Linux, Windows and macOS have been designed and delivered to address the vulnerability.\nThe other flaw, Spectre, is more difficult to exploit, and potentially more serious and trickier to fix properly. Spectre has been demonstrated on Intel Ivy Bridge, Haswell and Skylake processors, AMD Ryzen CPUs, and several ARM-based Samsung and Qualcomm system-on-chips that end up in smartphones.\nA combination of microcode updates and kernel countermeasures known as Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation (IBRS) have been developed to thwart attacks that steal data from kernels and hypervisors. But Intel has not yet released updated microcode for Linux users \u2013 official downloads date back to November 2017.\nReader Tim S told The Register: \"This has left Linux users and developers in the dark and has forced e.g. Debian developers to package unofficial versions dating from December but this doesn't patch many processors. Even for relatively recent processors such as Skylake desktop processors, the available packages (both official and 'unofficial') include Skylake microcodes dated April 2017 \u2013 before Intel was notified of the bugs \u2013 and so almost certainly don't patch the problem.\"\nAnother variant of Spectre, through which hackers might be able to spy on applications, remains unpatched. Several software-based mitigation approaches for Spectre have been suggested and may well have some utility, even though it looks like they will fall short of completely nailing the problem."

        "input": "DURING November 1968, in the aftermath of the previous year's Arab-Israeli Six Day War, a ''Joint Declaration by 20 representatives of the German left'' appeared in the American left Zionist magazine Jewish Frontier. It argued that the left ''would lose its credibility for all time to come if, through one-sided",
        "output": "sympathy for the Arabs, it were to contribute to a new Auschwitz''.\nThe declaration condemned the inconsistent ''crying out against the war of destruction being perpetrated by the Americans against the population of Vietnam and passing over in silence the far worse Holocaust being planned by the Arabs against Israel''. Signatories included the leading Marxist scholar Ernst Bloch and novelist Gunter Grass.\nAs many Western leftists abandoned Israel following its post-1967 occupation of the West Bank, Gaza, East Jerusalem, Sinai and the Golan Heights, instead embracing the then novel Palestinian cause, Grass remained pro-Israel. Some four decades later, few would describe Nobel-prize-winning author Grass, 83, in the same terms.\nGrass' controversial recent poem What Must Be Said, published in the German daily S\u00fc\u00a8ddeutsche Zeitung, severed any friendship that existed between himself and the Jewish state. Grass alleged that a nuclear-armed Israel ''threatens the already fragile world peace'' and railed against the inability of Germans to take Israel to task for fear of being labelled anti-Semitic. Nine stanzas of poetry sparked a global outcry.\nIt is self-evident that a former Waffen SS (Nazi military unit) member should exercise extreme caution when commenting upon the actions of the nation-state he unwittingly brought into existence. Still, the decision of Israeli Interior Minister Eli Yishai to declare Grass persona non grata scarcely requires condemnation. Censoring writers is the antithesis of liberal democracy, however repugnant their views may be.\nMuch of the debate over Grass' poem has centred on the equation of democratic Israel with the Iranian theocracy and his trivialisation of the existential threat posed by regime in Tehran (whose leader has threatened to ''wipe'' Israel from the map). Yet, perhaps the most repugnant element of Grass' poem was his Freudian suggestion that Israel was contemplating an attack in order to ''annihilate the Iranian people''.\nAt best, Grass is guilty of attention-seeking opportunism. At worst, his attack constitutes classical anti-Semitism in two respects.\nFirst, it rehashes allegations of mendacious Jewish behaviour and conspiratorial, censorious control of governments and the media.\nSecond, Grass's casting of Israel as the likely next perpetrator of genocide implies that Jews are collectively possessed of evil intentions.\nThe Grass scandal is hardly some isolated phenomenon. Rather it points to a far deeper intellectual and moral malaise on the political left, although as British journalist Nick Cohen pointed out in a penetrating recent essay for Standpoint magazine, what has been described as the new anti-Semitism from the far left and militant Islamic groups was in fact ''extraordinarily consistent'' during the previous century.\nAnti-Semitism masquerading as anti-Zionism has stolen a march in the early 21st century, albeit shorn of overt racism. Instead, the world's oldest hate manifests itself politically via the bizarre demand that Israel, alone among the world's nations, must cease to exist in favour of a bi-national Palestine. For academic Philip Mendes, such fundamentalist discourse demonises ''all Israeli Jews and all Jewish supporters of Israel as the political enemy''.\nMost depressing of all for this committed two-state supporter is the thundering silence of the Western left. As Ari Shavit, a columnist for the left-wing Israeli daily Haaretz, writes: Grass's poem ''doesn't contain Goebbels-like propaganda'' yet the ''words said by Grass and the words not said against Grass prove that the gangrene of delegitimisation is gradually spreading and devouring us''.\nAustralia, too, has not been immune to such developments. Witness the ugly Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions rallies staged outside the Israeli-owned chocolate shop Max Brenner throughout last year, where protesters literally chanted blood-libels (''There's blood in your hot chocolate''). Yet the response of leading left intellectuals, who ought to know better, was to uncritically defend the protesters.\nThose protests were the handiwork of Students for Palestine, a front group of the far-left Socialist Alternative group, itself routinely accused of anti-Semitism. It was no coincidence that the same folks recently planned to protest outside the Adass Israel Synagogue on Sabbath. Amazingly, the demonstration was cancelled not out of any concern about anti-Semitism but because ''anti-Zionist Jews'' were allegedly among the congregants.\nThis is a new twist on an old far-left strategy whereby the views of a tiny minority of radical anti-Zionist Jews are ostentatiously paraded. Not only is Israel routinely libelled, but anti-Semitism is written off as a disingenuous tactic of Zionist polemicists. Thus, Michael Brull, writing on ABC online's The Drum, described self-confessed jihadist Mohammed Merah, who last month murdered four French Jews, as not anti-Semitic but a ''secular'' killer.\nIsrael is hardly a perfect nation but the interventions of Grass et al are passing strange. Over the past 15 months, an estimated 13,000 Syrians have perished as a result of President Bashar Al-Assad's brutal crackdown. This is roughly the same number of casualties produced by the Israeli/Palestinian conflict since the onset of the 1948 war. Yet Grass's poetic stylings avoid altogether the continuing Syrian bloodbath. What must be said indeed.\nNick Dyrenfurth is the author of several books on Australian politics and history."
