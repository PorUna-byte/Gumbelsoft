A press release sent out by the Daniel Patterson Group yesterday characterized Ume as merely a \u201cpop-up,\u201d and a representative of the restaurant group told me that the intention was always to test to see whether the restaurant\u2019s Japanese-inspired cuisine and slightly more casual style of service would be a good fit for the neighborhood. That seems like a little bit of revisionist history \u2014 I certainly don\u2019t recall the word \u201cpop-up\u201d ever being used in the early days of the Ume reboot.\nRegardless, the verdict was clear: Despite generally positive reviews (including one from this critic), the restaurant often still had trouble filling seats. What people in the neighborhood wanted, Patterson concluded, was something even more casual and inexpensive. In short, what they wanted was more Plum Bar. And now, that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019re going to get.\nAmong other benefits, the expansion will allow Plum Bar + Restaurant to accommodate larger parties, which the bar never had room for previously when it was limited to the smaller adjacent space. The restructuring of the bar also coincides with a promotion for Ashley Miller, the opening bar manager at Alta CA (Patterson\u2019s newest San Francisco outpost), who has been appointed Bar Director for the entire restaurant group. Miller will use Plum Bar\u2019s expanded kitchen as her boozy base of operations.\n\u201cWe loved Ume, and so did a lot of people, but it wasn't what the neighborhood wants,\u201d Patterson said via email. He added that he eventually hopes to open another Ume \u2014 or a restaurant with a similar concept, in any case \u2014 at a different location.\nAccording to Patterson, Ume chef de cuisine Dong Choi has moved back to Atlanta for family reasons and, thus, won\u2019t be part of the new kitchen regime.

In 2010, 2.5 million foreclosures were initiated, with a similar number expected this year.\nThe FBI said mortgage origination schemes have declined due to the depressed market for home purchases.\nFraud targeting troubled borrowers, however, has increased and includes loan modification scams and foreclosure rescue schemes in which perpetrators convince borrowers they can save their homes through deed transfers and upfront fees.\nCardona said stock market fluctuations have also resulted in more Americans falling for fake investments.\nThe report listed \"hot spots\" for mortgage fraud. California, Florida and New York were among the hottest of those, in line with some of the worst unemployment and mortgage default rates in the country.\nSince the FBI was tasked with rooting out criminal activity that exacerbated the housing crisis in 2008, it has been criticized as ineffective against powerful executives of companies tied to the housing and financial industry.\n\"Although we tried mightily we just didn&apos;t hit the mark,\" Cardona said, referring to the aborted investigation of Washington Mutual Bank in early August.\nCardona said the government struggles to prove criminal intent in corporate crime.\nOne of the biggest cases so far was a $3 billion fraud case involving the privately held mortgage firm Taylor, Bean & Whitaker Mortgage Corp. The chairman of the firm, Lee Farkas, was sentenced to 30 years in prison after being convicted on 14 counts of conspiracy, wire, securities and bank fraud.\nCardona said the FBI is hoping the government can win more high-profile cases through civil probes.

It was here that in 1916 a British invasion force was besieged by the Turkish army and eventually forced to surrender. Of course, the present",
        "output": "occupation of Iraq doesn't yet face a disaster on this scale.\nBut the sense that the US and its allies-chief among them Britain-are becoming bogged down in a situation of which they are losing control is growing. It was crass stupidity to open two fronts simultaneously-ordering the Marines to crush the resistance in Fallujah and seeking to break the power of the radical Shia cleric Moqtada Sadr.\nBut the roots of the present crisis lie in contradictions inherent in the very project of Bush and his neo-con advisers. The military campaign was an advert for the model of \"transformational warfare\" that US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld has been seeking to impose on the Pentagon. A relatively small, highly mechanised and heavily armed force overwhelmed the Iraqi army and seized the main population centres within a few weeks.\nA long term military occupation of Iraq would allow the US to dominate the Middle East and control access to its huge oil reserves. But here was the first contradiction. Rumsfeld's military doctrine calls for small, highly mobile, high-tech forces. But such an army isn't geared to occupying a large, socially complex country like Iraq. The task of occupation required a large army spread in small, often vulnerable packets around Iraq, creating the risk of politically embarrassing casualties for the Bush administration.\nEarlier imperial powers like the British relied heavily on locally recruited mercenaries like the Indian army. But Bremer disbanded the Iraqi army, depriving the occupation of useful auxiliaries.\nThe US has tried to fill the troop gap by encouraging sympathetic governments to sign up to the \"coalition of the willing\". But the limits of this policy were exposed last week when the Ukrainian soldiers occupying Kut fled in the face of the insurgents.\nRumsfeld has accelerated the privatisation of the American military, filling Iraq with contractors and the ex-soldiers they hire as security guards. But these mercenaries aren't a military asset that the occupation chiefs can use, and are vulnerable to attack and kidnapping, as we have seen in the past fortnight.\nThe second great contradiction stems from the fact that, in the early 21st century, the US can't declare itself the colonial power in Iraq as Queen Victoria proclaimed herself Empress of India in the 1870s. So Bremer has had to try to assemble an Iraqi government that both is compliant with American wishes and enjoys democratic legitimacy.\nThe trouble is that the best way to gain legitimacy is through elections, and Iraqis would almost certainly use their votes to support political forces unpalatable to Washington.\nHence all the manoeuvring over what happens on 30 June, when the occupation is supposed to end. Till a few days ago the plan was for the US to hand \"sovereignty\" over to its hand-picked governing council with elections by the end of the year. Even these elections would change only appearances.\nThe US military occupation would continue, and Bremer is putting in place laws that will bind the hands of any elected government, leaving real power in the hands of the US embassy and the American corporations. Events of the past fortnight have now thrown this scenario into chaos. Bremer and the US military intended to avenge the lynching of four American mercenaries in Fallujah with a massive show of force.\nAll they have succeeded in doing is widening support for the resistance and exposing the weakness of the occupation. The siege of Fallujah is a terrifying reminder of the slaughter American firepower can inflict-600 people killed by last weekend. But it also revealed how skin-deep the power of the occupiers is.\nPatrick Graham wrote in The Observer, \"In the areas outside Fallujah, the US army controls only what it can shoot. Everything else is up for grabs.\" The US reliance on overwhelming force has so far secured no clear military victories and a severe political setback.\nA battalion in the new Iraqi army refused to fight in Fallujah. Even the timeservers on the Iraqi Governing Council were forced into revolt. Some resigned, others publicly denounced American tactics. They knew that identification with an occupying power bombarding Iraqi cities would destroy them politically.\nBremer has been forced to back down and agree to a truce in Fallujah. Meanwhile, in southern Iraq, far from being crushed, Moqtada Sadr's forces were entrenched in the holiest places of Shi'ite Islam in Karbala and Najaf. Tony Blair has adopted a defiant tone, declaring that \"dictators would rejoice, fanatics and terrorists would be triumphant\" if the occupation were defeated. Rumsfeld announced that more American troops would be sent to Iraq to defeat the \"thugs, gangs and terrorists\" fighting his forces.\nBut Rumsfeld can't respond to the crisis in Iraq by sending ever larger numbers of troops there, as President Lyndon Johnson did in Vietnam. American conscripts fought in Vietnam, but the US now relies on volunteers serving in an active duty army that, at 480,000, is proportionally the smallest in US history.\nIn the latest issue of Foreign Affairs, Lawrence Korb, former US assistant secretary of defence, describes the enormous pressure this army has been put under by the demands of the occupations in Iraq and Afghanistan. He quotes one expert who says, \"Our volunteer army is closer to being broken today than ever before in its 30-year history.\"\nAccording to Korb, \"Only two of the army's ten active divisions are ready for conflict outside Iraq and Afghanistan.\" The conquest of Iraq was the first test of the Bush doctrine of preventive war. But it has made it difficult, if not impossible, for the US to apply that doctrine elsewhere in the world, for example in north east Asia or Latin America.\nThe Bush administration is caught in a vice. Iraq is turning into a quagmire, but withdrawal would be the biggest defeat for US imperialism since Vietnam. Iraq was meant to demonstrate America's unrivalled global \"hegemony\". But it is beginning to look like a trap from which Bush and Blair cannot escape.\n'SIGNS THAT the new fighting is convincing some Iraqis to reassess their view of the insurgency are increasingly easy to find. Long lines have formed for blood drives and charity drop-offs to aid the besieged residents of Fallujah. Residents in many Baghdad neighbourhoods signed up to host displaced families from Fallujah, and banners and signs are posted at every corner declaring that the Sunni and Shia forces are now united.\nA cigarette seller in Baghdad said yesterday he has decided to collect tax from customers and contribute the money toward any militia that is fighting the Americans. The American public and its news media are raising questions about Iraq becoming another Vietnam for its troops.\nThe Iraqis and the Arab media have already started drawing a parallel between Iraqis and the Palestinians, tapping into feelings of Arab national pride, honour and victimisation.\nDespite US officials' claims that the uprisings have no grassroots support, the public's adherence to a cleric's call for a general strike demonstrates just how much the relationship between Americans and Iraqis has deteriorated in the past few weeks.\nThe streets of Baghdad were largely empty over the weekend, with the majority of businesses closed. Schools, universities and government buildings also closed. American military officials have so far contended that the 129,000 troops stationed in Iraq are sufficient."

Beatriz wants her to go on a weeklong road trip for some much-deferred mommy time, but Olivia, with her heart broken too many times by the mother who abandoned her, is understandably wary.\nBeatriz is concerned about her daughter\u2019s dark demeanor, especially after reading the blog by the literature-loving Olivia, \u201cCalling All Castaways,\u201d which reveal hints of suicide.\nUnbeknownst to Olivia is the fact that this cross-country journey has another purpose: The trip will end in an immigration hearing for the Mexico-born Beatriz, and where the daughter\u2019s testimony could help her mother from being deported.\nBut the show almost stalls just as it begins, starting with Beatriz\u2019 sketchy 4 a.m. arrival, the vagueness of Olivia\u2019s unseen father, and the too-quick-to-be-true acceptance of the road trip invite.\nThe human touches of the mother-daughter dynamic are the most appealing part of the show.

She treads the line between self-possessed toughness and walking-wounded with complete authenticity.\nIn the tradition of road trip narratives, mother and daughter encounter colorful characters (including a retired gay couple with a mission of their own, played with quirky charm by David Patrick Kelly and Michael Mulheren) as well as hardships and setbacks (car problems, an arrest, clearing up an old marijuana misdemeanor).\nThe production, staged by Lear deBessonet, is low-tech to a fault, with an undistinguished set, basic choreography/movement and minimal use of an ensemble. However, singer-songwriter Erin McKeown makes an impressive stage debut with music that is eclectic and appealing, though the lyrics she co-wrote with Hudes are too often an odd mix of fleeting grace and awkwardness.\nStill, there\u2019s some lovely melodies, including Rubin-Vega\u2019s \u201cOver My Shoulder;\u201d \u201cTamales,\u201d sung with tenderness by Danny Bolero as a widower they encounter along the way; and \u201cYellowstone,\u201d sung by Latoya Edwards, a devoted fan follower of Olivia\u2019s lonely-teen blog and who becomes a side-trip destination. And by the end, it\u2019s hard not to be moved by the newly earned parent-child bond, by lessons learned on a road well-traveled and, ultimately, by walls that stand in the way of loving families.\nNewman Theater at the Public Theater; 299 seats: $90 top; reviewed April 5, 2018; opens April 10, 2018.

        "output": "alleged sins during the election campaign, condemning specific reporters, including some who were in the room.\nEach of the five networks sent at least one top executive, and in some cases three or four. None of the executives or journalists had the courage to walk out, denounce Trump as a bully, or warn that the First Amendment would be under attack under a Trump administration as never before in the history of the United States.\nThe very fact that the media heads agreed to such an \u201coff the record\u201d meeting is an abomination. The president of the United States is not \u201ccommander-in-chief\u201d of the media. But Trump summoned highly paid television anchormen and women, and their even more highly paid corporate bosses, who cravenly submitted to a tongue-lashing at Trump Tower.\nTrump was accompanied at the session by his chief of staff Reince Priebus, chief White House strategist Stephen Bannon, campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, campaign spokesman Jason Miller, Republican National Committee communications director Sean Spicer, and son-in-law Jared Kushner.\nBannon is an ally of the \u201cwhite nationalist\u201d and \u201calt-right\u201d elements who patronize Breitbart News, the ultra-right online site that Bannon ran until he signed on as Trump\u2019s campaign CEO in August. His appointment as co-leader of Trump\u2019s White House staff, sharing authority with Priebus, signals the entry of the fascistic right into the mainstream of American capitalist politics.\nAfter Monday\u2019s media session, according to Conway, there was a \u201creceiving line\u201d of media executives and anchors to meet Bannon, who played a largely behind-the-scenes role during the campaign. \u201cMany people wanted to meet him and talk to him, make some eye contact, exchange some business cards with him. That\u2019s just a fact,\u201d she told the MSNBC program \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on Tuesday.\nThe closed-door meeting between Trump and the media is a gross violation of the by now threadbare tradition, more than two centuries old, whereby the press is supposed to constitute a \u201cFourth Estate,\u201d an independent watchdog on the activities of the executive, legislative and judicial branches of the government.\nIt is true that for more than a generation, the corporate-controlled media has largely defaulted on this role. More than 40 years have passed since critical coverage of the Vietnam War culminated in the publication of the Pentagon Papers, and the exposures of White House criminality in the Watergate scandal culminated in the forced resignation of President Richard Nixon.\nToday, the watchword of the corporate media is conformity and complacency, while what passes for the \u201cnews\u201d is spoon-fed to them by the White House, Pentagon, State Department and CIA. While individual reporters may still take risks and challenge authority\u2014a rare occurrence\u2014the major news organizations, owned and controlled by giant corporations, are engaged in the manufacture and dissemination of government and corporate propaganda.\nTrump\u2019s session with the television broadcasters was followed by a closed-door meeting Tuesday with the publisher of the New York Times, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, and a longer on-the-record discussion with Times reporters and columnists, leading to a flurry of reports claiming that the president-elect was \u201cmoderating\u201d his positions on a number of issues.\nThese reports are, on their face, complete nonsense. Trump told the Times that climate change may be caused by human action, that a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton was a bad idea, and that he disavowed support from white racist and alt-right groups. Even if these were taken for good coin\u2014and there is certainly no reason to do so\u2014this is setting an absurdly low bar for calling Trump a changed man.\nSo anxious were the networks to stay on the right side of the president-elect that NBC, in its report Tuesday night on Trump\u2019s purported shifts in policy, did not refer to where these comments were made, at a meeting with the New York Times, in order to avoid reporting on its own encounter with Trump the day before.\nTrump treats the media with complete contempt, while basing his election campaign in large part on free media publicity. He has not held a press conference since July, preferring to be flattered in interviews by sympathetic Fox News hosts. He has not held a press conference since the election to explain to the public his plans for the new administration, another longstanding democratic tradition trampled on.\nThe shameless rush by the media establishment to ingratiate itself with Trump, only days after an election campaign in which they for the most part portrayed him as a political pariah and moral monster, expresses not only the protracted disintegration of American democracy in general, but more specifically the closing of ranks within the American ruling class behind the ultra-nationalist \u201cAmerica first\u201d orientation he embodies.\nThis has found a no less noxious expression in the prostration of the Democratic Party before Trump, led by President Barack Obama, and the lineup of its congressional leadership, from incoming Senate Democratic leader Charles Schumer to the supposed \u201clefts\u201d Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, behind Trump\u2019s program of economic nationalism and trade war.\nIf this is how Trump treats the corporate-controlled media, owned by billionaires like himself and staffed by multi-millionaire celebrities who would never think of questioning the capitalist system, what can be expected when the Trump administration encounters genuine criticism and opposition from the working class? This is a government whose actions and appointments demonstrate ferocious hostility to democratic rights.\nThe working class must prepare its own response. This includes defending and increasing the influence of the only genuine media voice of the socialist working class, the World Socialist Web Site."

        "output": "relief,\" she said.\nWhether for relaxation or diversion, full-time workers are squeezing time into their schedules for mobile games. They are launching flying birds, flicking onscreen candies, and building words on virtual boards using their smartphones or tablets.\nSpil Games reports about 700 million people play online games, or about 44 percent of the world's online population. And those numbers are expected to rise.\nThe habit can be addictive and not just for actor Alex Baldwin, who was kicked off a plane for refusing to turn off his phone in the middle of a \"Words with Friends\" match. Other players admit to being so immersed they have left their children stranded at sports practices, gone late to work and even injured themselves as they tried to reach new levels of play.\nSerota of Weiss Serota Helfman reluctantly acknowledges that at times she has become so caught up in completing a level of \"Candy Crush\" that she has arrived late at an event.\n\"When you're in the moment, you're focusing on the game and you're just not thinking about other things,\" she said.\nNot long ago, most gamers were young men playing on at-home consoles. Now, the advent of smartphones and tablets has changed gaming so much so that 46 percent of players are women, according to Spil Games' 2013 state of online gaming report.\n\"We have so much on our minds and just want an escape,\" said Marci Siegel, a medical recruiter and working mother who enjoys \"Candy Crush\" and \"Words with Friends.\" Siegel estimates she spends about seven hours per week playing the games on her phone.\n\"Sometimes, my day is so crazy that I need a little guilty pleasure,\" she said.\nCritics contend that playing online games is a time-waster. Gamers argue it brings balance to their lives by offering entertainment, stress relief, social connections and mental stimulation. For players that log in with Facebook or Google Plus, the games allow friendly competition and social interaction.\nRecognizing the appeal, employers have begun finding ways to leverage gaming in the workplace. Tapping experts, they are designing games to motivate workers, recruit talent, teach new skills, boost performance and encourage wellness.\nThrough Facebook, Marriott Hotels has introduced \"My Marriott Hotel,\" which offers players a virtual chance to manage a hotel restaurant kitchen before moving on to other areas of hotel operations. Marriott said it wanted to harness the exploding popularity of social media gaming to help generate interest in hospitality careers and fill positions worldwide.\nAnd the United Kingdom's Department of Work and Pensions uses gamification to encourage innovative thinking through a social game called Idea Street. Game mechanics, points and leader boards have encouraged thousands of employees to submit ideas. To maintain interest, an innovation team publishes a weekly newsletter that focuses on the ideas gaining the most attention and those that may need tweaking.\nGoing forward, experts say workplaces likely will show more interest in gamification. In 2012, 20 percent of Forbes Global 2000 companies featured a gamified application. Research firm Gartner predicts that by the end of this year, 70 percent of those companies will have implemented at least one.\nGartner also predicts some attempts will fail.\n\"It's not just about entertainment,\" Burke said. \"It's about designing an experience, creating ongoing engagement and customizing the application as you go.\"\nFor workers like Ryan Bard, who grew up playing video games, the draw is positive reinforcement - a rarity in many workplaces. Just about every interactive game employs some kind of reward system to keep players engaged.\nBard, a father of two and information technology support provider at a South Florida vacation services firm, said it is the micro-achievements that entice him to spend hours of free time playing games on consoles, computers and mobile devices. \"It's not just beating a game and getting to the end,\" he said. \"There are lots of layers and rewards built in.\"\nOf course, it's hard to deny the addictive nature of mobile gaming with challenges and prizes that are dribbled out to keep players hooked and spending. Maria Redlich tries to control the time and money she spends on games. For five years, she has spent three hours or more a day playing \"Mafia Wars,\" \"Castle Age\" and, more recently, \"Uno\" and \"Scrabble\" on her computer and tablet. A former Miami-Dade classroom teacher and now a reading coach, Redlich said the online games provide an outlet for her frustration while testing her resolve.\n\"I see people spending a lot of money and I could easily do that ... but I have to remind myself it's supposed to be a way to relax,\" she said."

Typically, mules are paid for their services.\nCriminals are resorting more and more to this kind of fraud ever since the banks began using biometrics to verify account holders, and it has grown to such an extent that it has been defined as a new category of fraud by the South African Fraud Prevention Service (SAFPS).\nMore than 90% of money mule transactions are linked to cyber-related crimes such as phishing, online auction fraud, business e-mail compromise and CEO fraud, according to a 2017 report by Europol, the European Union's law enforcement agency.\nIf you get reported for having acted as a money mule, your name and ID number will be listed by the SAFPS, which hosts a database of the names of people involved in various types of fraudulent behaviour. Being listed on such a database has far-reaching implications because it is shared among financial services providers.\nThe SAFPS hasn't begun listing people for money muling yet but will be doing so as soon as the systems are in place for the banks to report this type of misdeed to the SAFPS, says Manie van Schalkwyk, the executive director of SAFPS.\n\"Only the banks can report to the SAFPS and only after they have investigated and have prima facie evidence of money muling.

They checked in with me about 12, 12:30 and then I went to bed.\"\nThe next morning [June 14, 2015], she went to Jack's room for some laundry. He was unresponsive. She yelled for Nick, who was downstairs with friends, but he didn't run up to help. That's when she called 911.\n\"Little did I know there was another 911 call that came out of our basement,\" she said. \"Nick's friends had heard me calling for help and went to wake up Nick and Nick was unresponsive as well.\"\nThey both overdosed. Savage said her boys drank at a graduation party and took pills offered to them.\nShe never expected this. They'd never been in trouble before.\nSavage said she wants students to know, a decision only has to be made one time to impact family and friends forever. She spoke at Anderson County High School, hosted by student group 'Saving Our Students'.\nSavage said, \"I want these kids to know that they're important, that choices they make can have a lasting impact, not only on them, but on their family and friends, and to focus on making good choices.\"\nShe went on to say she hopes her sons lives continue to make a difference.\n\"Every crowd I look out to I know there are Nick and Jack's out in that crowd, good kids, kids who maybe are naive to the dangers that are out there and we're just hoping to touch one life.\"\nCounty officials from the sheriff's office, coroner's office and courthouse were also at the presentation, talking with students."

        "output": "labeled as rebellious.\nThey are looked down upon and thought of as troublemakers for the simple reason of having a differing perspective towards certain situations. More so, for questioning the moral values behind cultural practices that have been followed over centuries.\nThe real question is whether these well-informed individuals are correctly labeled so or are they, unlike people have been for many decades, thinking beyond just the traditional value of some practices.\nFor example, there is a young girl living in a small village, where the sole purpose of women is to give birth to and raise children, whilst cooking food for the entire family. After spending over ten years in this village witnessing this \u2018tradition\u2019, she disagrees with this practice and questions why the women, along with performing these duties, can\u2019t earn a living as well. Especially if they wish to and believe they have the mental and physical capacity to do so.\nDoes this opinionated question and the desire to change this tradition make that young girl a rebel? No. In fact, it makes her a rational thinker who is putting forward a genuine query that her mind has brought up after wonderment regarding said village for several years.\nAnother distinct case of someone wrongly being labeled as rebellious is of a young boy, for example, who has been expected to become an engineer and make a career out of it for his entire adulthood, ever since he was born.\nSay this boy grows to learn that he has no interest in that field whatsoever but instead is exceedingly fond of photography and has an exceptionally unique artistic touch while taking photos.\nHe then manifests that he wants to make a career out of photography but everyone around him immediately refuses exclaiming that this is not a feasible career path. Will calling this young boy rebellious be appropriate? No, as he is simply standing up again the mindset of only conventional career paths being practical in the long run.\nHence, he is using his own individualistic thinking and interests to write his own life\u2019s journey, which is nothing short of rational thinking.\nIn conclusion, before labeling individuals as plainly rebellious, the reasons for their opinionated gestures and refusal to follow certain norms should be taken into account.\nMany at times they might turn out to be making a remarkably sensible point and helping our society to move towards a more progressive lifestyle."

        "input": "When I look at what is going wrong for Liverpool at the moment, a lot of it stems from the engine room of the team - the midfield.\nThe biggest problem I have there is with Jordan Henderson and Emre Can playing together in the Reds' 4-3-3 formation.\nThey both play too",
        "output": "many sideways balls, which are pretty looking and keep possession - but do not hurt the opposition.\nDon't get me wrong, I think Henderson has had a good season, while Can is not in particularly poor form - he has just had an average season. It happens.\nBut, together, they do not fit in with the way Liverpool have to play to open teams up, which is one of the reasons the goals have dried up for Jurgen Klopp's side recently.\nI have heard it suggested recently that Liverpool need a midfield general - a new Steven Gerrard, if you like.\nThat would be fantastic, obviously, but it's unlikely to happen in the summer. There are not many players around who can do everything in defence and attack, like Gerrard could, and if you find one then he is going to be very expensive.\nWhat I think they need, and also have a more realistic chance of getting, is a player who compliments the ones they have already got, but can do the things that Henderson or Can cannot - which is control the tempo the team plays at.\nRather than look for someone who can do it all, they actually need a player with more creativity to play alongside either Henderson or Can - and, at the moment, I would choose Henderson out of those two.\nHenderson covers the ground effectively and protects his back four, but I would like to see someone in there next to him with a little bit more guile on the ball, to use it more effectively.\nI am talking about a midfield player whose first touch is always to get the ball out of his feet and then be looking to play it forward if the pass is on.\nIt's a job Michael Carrick does so well for Manchester United. He does not look to bomb on himself, but he has the nous to play the right ball.\nAt the moment, Henderson and Can get the ball and they get rid of it straight away. Sometimes they pass it forward, but a lot of the time it goes sideways.\nIt is too safe, and it means the team moves the ball too slowly and often takes too many touches as well.\nThat gives the opposition time to regroup and get organised, which is why they are not bothered when Liverpool dominate possession.\nSome of Liverpool's other issues are pretty obvious - they are not good enough defensively to buy themselves enough time in games when they are not playing well.\nUp front, Daniel Sturridge does not fit into this team. He is not the answer, so I think it is time to get rid of him.\nThere are some positives, though. The collapse in Liverpool's form in 2017 is certainly not down to the attitude of their players.\nI don't think it is down to them being tired either, and I have watched most of their games this year.\nI would question their style of play at the moment, though. It is too predictable, too narrow and too nice.\nLiverpool always play in the same 4-3-3 formation, and the opposition are ready for it. They know they will be up against fast, tricky forwards who try to cut inside.\nI would describe their attacking play as being like a funnel, with everything being channelled centrally.\nEvery other team know that, and are putting numbers there, then continuing to send Liverpool's players inside.\nThey know Liverpool are not going to change and play balls up to a big striker, they are just going to keep trying to get into the last third of the pitch and, when they are there, try one-twos or clever flicks.\nAn easy way of stopping that is by having plenty of men back and, at the moment, Liverpool do not have the nous to break down anyone who does it.\nThe problems Liverpool have got at the moment are part of the reason I think they are better off playing against the other top teams.\nAs I have mentioned in my weekly predictions, on Saturday, Tottenham will be one of the few teams in the last few weeks to come to Anfield and not just sit in a 4-5-1 formation with all their men in their own half.\nSpurs are good defensively and well organised full-stop, but their full-backs will bomb on and that will give Liverpool some space to work with, especially on the counter-attack.\nSo the fact that Klopp's side also have to play Arsenal and Manchester City in their upcoming fixtures is not a bad thing. Those teams will also be open, and they will let Liverpool play.\nLiverpool will be back - as in they will rediscover their form - but it might take the kind of gladiatorial atmosphere you get in games against the other leading teams to bring out the best in them again.\nIt is disappointing that their title hopes have disappeared now, of course, but you have to remember that their target at the start of the season was a top-four finish for the first time since 2014.\nExpectations were raised by that purple patch before Christmas, when it looked like they would be Chelsea's closest challengers. That is no longer the case, clearly.\nBut they still have a good chance of securing Champions League football and, if they achieve that, then they will still have had a good season."

        "output": "English football for the Portuguese might unnerve some managers, but Mourinho looks stronger than ever. The 42-year-old surpassed even his wildest boasts last season when Chelsea cruised not only to their first championship for 50 years, but did it by breaking a number of records along the way.\nChelsea were not taken too seriously as challengers by Arsenal and Manchester United before the start of the campaign, but the west London club ended it with a new best points tally in the top flight (95), fewest goals conceded (15), as well as most wins (29) and most clean sheets (24).\nThe worry for Arsene Wenger and Sir Alex Ferguson is that Mourinho is feeling more relaxed going into his second season in charge. While some managers never find the time to switch off from the rigours of football, the self-proclaimed 'Special One' has such a strong team of staff at his disposal that he was happy to make two trips to the cinema with his two children this week, despite the start of the season looming.\n'What do I do when I relax? I'm with my kids and the other day I went with them to see Fantastic Four ,' Mourinho said. 'For my kids it was the third time in a week, for me it was the second time. When the film was on, I don't think about Chelsea at all.\n'Some managers may not be able to switch off, but it is not like that with me. I have the club very well organised, with top people working in different areas. They are in contact with me and I don't need to be involved 24 hours per day or go to the office at Stamford Bridge every day.\n'Maybe that is because I have good help. Peter Kenyon [the chief executive] and people are doing their jobs and respecting their areas. We are working the same, but in separate areas. Maybe we have such a good working structure I don't have to be involved in that, but if we are talking purely football, we are organised.\nBut then it soon becomes clear as to how Mourinho can keep his cool when he starts talking about his life before he hit the big time as a football manager. The former Porto coach was already part of a rare breed in that his playing career was virtually non-existent, but he still got to the top.\nHowever, his remarkable success is not the only thing that sets him apart. While he was learning his profession and coaching Vitoria de Setubal under-18s as a young man, he was also working with disabled children in his home town.\nHe has said that he would happily be doing the same work if his career had not taken off in the manner it did, but the experience has taught him many valuable lessons, including keeping a sense of perspective when winning the Premiership threatens to become all-consuming.\n'I did it for three years and at the same time I was coaching Vitoria de Setubal under-18. I worked from 8am to 2pm and then had a train ing session at 4pm. I was happy. I think it taught me to think that we and especially the players are privileged people and sometimes you create a nightmare for nothing. I realised a lot about these kids and when I think of players and how they can make a war or be unhappy because they are not playing or not selected, it is ridiculous.\n'It helped me the same way it helps people who travel to Africa and sees kids who are dying in every corner. I don't feel pressure because I have seen people with real problems. I was enjoying the job very much. You can imagine a kid who cannot walk and after two years the kid is already climbing stairs. It is a big victory.\n'When I go home now and again, I see one of the kids because my city is a very small place. Football is less important, but I don't change my life now. I really love what I do and this is the life I always wanted and I don't change for nothing.\nBut if you think Mourinho is a good role model, he insisted that it is nothing compared with his wife, Tami. Mourinho knows that she will not allow their son and daughter to take their wealth for granted.\n'My wife is even more important than me,' he said. 'My wife has a lot of values in that area. She is Portuguese, but because her father was in the military she was born in Angola. She has a big, big feeling with Africa, what is related to Africa, kids dying, bombs and disabled and all the misery in Africa. She is very influenced by that.\""

He loves what the program can do for vets and their families. However, the lack of an easy access door has soured some of the participants.\n\u201cThey\u2019d rather have that handicap access button, so they can do it on their own,\" he said. \"That\u2019s self-sufficiency. When other people have to help them, number one, it\u2019s embarrassing. Two, they feel they\u2019re not self-sufficient. That\u2019s what VA is all about and the Life Skills is about -- to promote confidence.\nAt this week\u2019s ribbon cutting, Sallie Houser-Hanfelder, the director of the Rocky Mountain Regional VA Medical Center, was asked about this problem.\n\"We\u2019re working on the issue of what are and aren\u2019t,\" Houser-Hanfelder said. \"There are some that aren\u2019t accessible to patients. We\u2019re working on that. There\u2019s some push plates we need to put in. The life skills center is in the old building. We\u2019re working on that to get that outer door handicap accessible.\"\nHowever, hidden cameras found another big problem with access in another area as well: On the ground floor garage next to the spinal injury and trauma center.\nNew working handicap access doors to get inside from handicap parking spots were found, but only into a short hallway.\nThe next set of heavy doors, which leads to the care area, are not accessible to anyone in a wheelchair or with other mobility issues.\nA few days after that ribbon cutting, and that promise to fix the doors, FOX31 went back to check on the progress.\nWe not only found more broken, non-compliant ADA doors, we also ran into some resistance to our persistence.\nWhile a camera crew was standing on a sidewalk outside the Life Skills Center getting video of that door, an unidentified VA staff person and public affairs officer Brandy Morrison approached.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry sir. Are you still filming? Can you please stop? You are not authorized to film on campus,\" Morrison said.\nFOX31 immediately left the property and finished recording across the street.\nOn Wednesday, VA public affairs sent a new statement, addressing the access point near the Life Skills Center.\n\u201cBuilding A\u2019s exterior door was never meant to be a permanent entrance, and beginning July 30, all Veterans will use the building\u2019s primary entry point, which is through the Parking Visitor South entrance, concourse and breezeway,\" according to the statement."

        "output": "giving it to the consumer.\nIt is like the music for our iPod; dematerialized bits and bytes put together again where we need it, without the waste of a physical intermediary. In a world where we watch our carbon as closely as our waistline we don't want to be driving to the big box stores; in a world where almost everything can be digitized, why move material when we are interested in ideas, creativity and talent?\nThe desire for 3-D printing to take over from traditional manufacturing needs to be recognized for what it is: an ideology. Getting all of our goods from a box in the corner of our home has attractive implications, from mass customization to \"the end of consumerism.\" With stakes like those, who wouldn't want to be a true believer.\nAdvocates of 3-D printing also neglect entirely the fact that so much of what we use continues to be made out of natural substances, and for good reason. By any number of measures, wood is pound-for-pound stronger than steel, and the move toward natural products for packaging suggests that the strength and affordability of paper, bamboo and even mushrooms mean that in the future there will be more and not less of all of these.\nI was convinced that it was just too soon in the development of the 3D printers, reminding readers of what we went through with 2D printers, where we all had go through the low res dot matrix phase, and that it took almost 30 years to get to where everyone can own a laser printer. That fancier stereolithographic home printers like the FormLabs machine would give us all the resolution and quality we were looking for. Not.\nAs Cranz in Gizmodo notes, \"the 3D home printer market has quietly crashed in the intervening years\u2014brought down by extremely low-quality print materials, a painfully long and difficult print process, and worst of all, a complete lack of interest from the general public.\"\nI learned CAD programs for architecture and then Rhino for product development, spent years at University getting the skills I needed to be an architect; it's tough. But just like having a plotter doesn't make you an architect, or having a laser printer doesn't make you an author, having a 3D printer doesn't make you an industrial designer. It is exactly that, a printer. At some point soon there will be a critical mass of designs available to be printed and quality high enough to make it worthwhile having.\nClearly, I was wrong about that, and the stuff that one can get is not exactly making the heart pump with desire. Of course, 3D printers and other tools for doing digital fabrication are being used in industry and by hobbyists all over the world and even in space; they just haven't found their place in the home. And remember what Mims titled his post: Why 3-D Printing Will Go the Way of Virtual Reality. VR seems to be getting pretty big right now. Perhaps it is all still just too soon to tell.\nIt was so big a few years ago; now even Makerbot is throwing in the home 3D printed towel."

        "output": "it would use the proceeds from a recent bond sale with Argentina to finance Glover's biopic of Toussaint Louverture, an iconic figure in the Caribbean who led an 18th-century revolt in Haiti.\nIt will also give seed money for a film version of The General in His Labyrinth, Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's novel about the last days of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, who liberated much of South America from Spanish colonialism.\nGlover, 60, who starred with Mel Gibson in the Lethal Weapon series, and more recently with Eddie Murphy in the film DreamGirls, is a civil rights activist and supporter of Mr Ch\u00e1vez's radical leftwing policies.\nA document from the congress's finance commission said the culture ministry would be a partner with Glover and give $17.8m for \"scripts, production costs, wardrobe, lighting, transport, makeup and the creation of the whole creative and administrative platform\".\nThe project could mark a breakthrough for Villa del Cine, a new government-funded studio outside the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, which is part of Mr Ch\u00e1vez's effort to combat what he sees as American cultural hegemony.\nGlover, who visited Caracas at the weekend, told the Guardian that he would direct the film, titled Toussaint. \"It's so advanced that you can taste it. We've scouted locations within 75km [45 miles] of Caracas. I can do everything I need to do with this film from here.\" He said he had been in talks with the government, but was unaware that a decision had been made until journalists tipped him off about the congress's announcement. \"That's the first I've heard of it,\" he said.\nHe suggested that there was still some uncertainty over whether the venture would go ahead. \"One of the major axioms in theatre is never talk about anything until the deal is signed. There's a lot of deliberation that goes on before something actually happens.\"\nIt appeared that the congress timed the announcement to coincide with a media conference in Caracas hosted by the television network Telesur, a Venezuela-funded regional answer to CNN. Glover is on the board.\nIt would not be the first declaration to run ahead of reality. Mr Ch\u00e1vez once said the director Oliver Stone planned to make a film about him, but it came to nothing. However at the president's request, Villa del Cine, which was inaugurated last year, is making a film about Francisco Miranda, who lit the fuse of South America's liberation. A lavish production with hundreds of extras and battle scenes, its costumes and sets could work for the Haiti film.\nToussaint Louverture is a towering figure in the region's history. A freed slave of African descent, he led thousands of slaves in successful campaigns against British, Spanish and French troops before being betrayed, captured and exiled. He died in 1803, just before his followers succeeded in establishing the island's independence. William Wordsworth wrote a sonnet about him.\nGlover said he wanted to educate the US about the story. \"It's been essentially wiped out of our historic memory, it's been wiped clean.\"\nThe actor is chairman of the TransAfrica Forum, an advocacy group for African Americans and other members of Africa's diaspora, and a vocal critic of the Bush administration. Along with the singer Harry Belafonte, Glover is the best known celebrity supporter of Mr Ch\u00e1vez, whom he considers \"remarkable\". He is a regular visitor to Venezuela.\nVenezuela's congress, which consists entirely of Ch\u00e1vez supporters, also said it would give $1.8m to develop a screen treatment of The General in His Labyrinth, by a Venezuela-born director, Alberto Arvelo. Some rate Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's account of the final days of Bol\u00edvar along with the Colombian writer's better known novels, One Hundred Years of Solitude and Love in the Time of Cholera.\nTo build consciousness of what Mr Ch\u00e1vez calls \"21st-century socialism\", the government has funded nationwide screenings of Charlie Chaplin's classic film Modern Times, about the exploitation of US factory workers during the depression."

Calls to Alves\u2019 mobile phone revealed that it has been turned off while those to Corbin have not been returned.\nThe PPC\u2019s investigation is expected to provide details on the four emergency contracts and is to outline how ANSA McAL was awarded the bulk of the over $605m purchases without the knowledge of the National Procurement and Tender Administration Board (NPTAB). New GPC, the Eccles, East Bank Demerara-based Health 2000 and Canadian entity Chirosyn Discovery were the other suppliers in the emergency process.\nThe GPHC Board has not said much on its investigations except for Alves stating last month that she will address the matter when the investigation was completed.\nQuestions have been raised about what is taking the PPC so long when all of the documentary evidence is available for an investigation of the transaction. The length of time taken is also puzzling as the PPC commissioners function on a full-time basis.

Lawrence, in her defence, has said that while she \u201cfast-tracked\u201d the purchases because of the emergency needs of the GPHC, she didn\u2019t have anything to do with the actual procurement.\nLawrence has said that for the first two months of this year, a total of $1,304,439,390 was spent on drugs for the Georgetown Public Hospital Corporation. The total is nearly double what was spent for the whole of last year.\nAlso stated was that tenders for the procurement of both pharmaceuticals and medical supplies were invited, except in the instance of the emergency supplies, for which restrictive tendering was used.\nLawrence also told the National Assembly, in response to questions posed by the opposition, that $1,635,070,822 was spent in 2016 for the procurement of drugs. The minister noted in her written response that this sum represented 95.1% of the budgeted allocation for the year.\nShe further explained that $395,251,668 in supplies were not delivered within the time stipulated by the contracts. Of the three identified suppliers who failed to deliver on time, the New Guyana Pharmaceutical Agency accounted for more than 90% of this sum.\nNew GPC failed to supply $381,193,319 in products, while ANSA McAl Trading Ltd failed to supply $12,488,630 and Global Healthcare Supplies Inc., $2,569,719.\nShe has said that all the contracts were publicly advertised and awarded by the NPTAB."

        "output": "Lake in this aerial photograph taken in 2015. Staff file photo by Gabe Souza Three wind turbines are seen atop a ridge just south of Webb Lake in this aerial photograph taken in 2015.\nWind power developers say they are holding off on billions of dollars in investments in new Maine wind farms until they see whether the next governor will be a friend or foe of renewable energy.\nWith one Democrat and two liberal independents among the four candidates in the race, the question may come down to whether Republican Shawn Moody wins the election and maintains the anti-wind stance of Gov. Paul LePage.\nNow in the final months of his second term, the Republican governor has erected barriers in the path of wind development that have deterred new investments and created a climate of uncertainty.\nHe said the association\u2019s members are considering projects that represent $3 billion to $5 billion worth of investment, but are waiting to see what happens in November. These members include national and international companies such as NextEra Energy, Longroad Energy Partners and EDP Renewables.\nPayne\u2019s comments followed a panel discussion last Tuesday at the American Wind Energy Association\u2019s Northeast conference, held in South Portland. The panel included some of Maine\u2019s top political analysts, who offered their opinions on how wind energy has become swept up in partisan politics and whether that will change after LePage leaves office in January. A strident critic, LePage last winter ordered a moratorium on wind development in most of the state. He more recently created a commission to review \u2013 behind closed doors \u2013 the impact of wind farms on tourism. The moratorium is being challenged in court, and media outlets are seeking the agenda and member names of the study group.\nNo new wind farms have started up in Maine since 2016 and no new applications are pending. Politics is just one reason why. Developers must secure power purchase agreements, typically with utilities in southern New England. They also need firm transmission connections to the electric grid. Both are presenting challenges today.\nBut Matt Kearns, chief development officer at Longroad Energy, said November\u2019s election will matter because political leadership helps set the tone for investment.\nLongroad Energy is an example of overseas investment looking to Maine. It\u2019s largely financed by an Australian energy company and a sovereign wealth fund that helps underwrite pension payments in New Zealand. Kearns said the company wants to file an application before year\u2019s end for a 22-turbine project in the Hancock County town of Eastbrook, called Weaver Wind. The project is valued at $140 million.\nWith 923 megawatts of installed capacity spread over 16 commercial projects, Maine already produces at least four times more wind power than any other state in New England. Last year, wind accounted for 20 percent of the power generated in Maine, according to new data from the federal Energy Information Administration.\nMost of the large wind farms in Maine were built to satisfy clean-energy policies in Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island. They were developed in Maine because the state has miles of remote ridgelines where winds are steady, and a predictable permitting process at the Department of Environmental Protection and Land Use Planning Commission.\nAnd while resistance persists from some residents and citizen groups that oppose the visual and audible impacts of large wind turbines on forested ridgelines, opposition in rural Maine has proved to be less of an obstacle than developers might encounter in more populated parts of New England.\nBut opponents were buoyed by LePage\u2019s stance and hope to influence the next governor. One group, Friends of Maine\u2019s Mountains, said it\u2019s urging candidates to do a \u201csober analysis\u201d of wind energy\u2019s negative impacts, versus its benefits.\nAgainst this backdrop, Tuesday\u2019s panel discussion provided some insight into the role of Maine\u2019s next governor in this ongoing debate.\nModerated by Payne, the panel was made up of Hans Kaiser, a principal at Moore Information, a Washington, D.C., opinion research group that has worked extensively in Maine; Lance Dutson, a Republican political and campaign strategist; David Farmer, a Democratic campaign strategist and former deputy chief of staff for Gov. John Baldacci; and Ben Gilman, senior government relations attorney at the Maine State Chamber of Commerce.\nFarmer recounted how a special task force set up by Baldacci led to Maine\u2019s 2008 Wind Energy Act, which set ambitious goals for wind development and sped up permits in certain areas of the state. Energy prices were high then, a deep recession looming. But any consensus around the benefits of wind power has faded, he said, replaced by a sharp ideological divide.\nThat divide, Dutson said, has widened into a \u201ccultural and tribal schism\u201d that defies traditional Republican values. Cutting red tape and setting up zones favorable to industry should be embraced by Republicans as a model for attracting other businesses, he said.\nIn the current partisan divide, Republicans tend to be against wind power, while Democrats are for it. But it\u2019s not that simple when looking to who might be elected Maine\u2019s next governor, Kaiser said.\nDemocrats, he said, are more likely to support a Republican who favors wind power, but not the other way around. He cited Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, a Republican governor bringing investment to his state by supporting offshore wind energy, in part by working across party lines.\nThat led Gilman to make this observation: In his view, the two independent candidates in the race \u2013 Alan Caron and Terry Hayes \u2013 are essentially Democrats. Janet Mills is a Democrat. So Shawn Moody, the Republican, is really running against three Democrats.\nBoth Gilman and Dutson said they expect Moody to be Maine\u2019s next governor. Farmer said he thinks Mills will win.\nWhoever wins, Payne said, that person will need to repair Maine\u2019s reputation, if it wants to welcome investment from the renewable energy industry. LePage, Payne noted, boasted in 2011 about erecting a sign near Maine\u2019s southern border on Interstate 95, proclaiming the state \u201copen for business.\u201d But that\u2019s hasn\u2019t been true for clean energy, he said.\nPicking up on that theme, Farmer asked the audience at the wind conference \u2013 many of them industry professionals from outside Maine \u2013 if they had heard of Maine\u2019s governor.\nThen Farmer asked if anything they heard was good.\nIt was hard to see any hands raised."

It's right at the cap of acceptable size. It is likely all or most of them belong in an AP class, but the dynamic of this group is extremely different than last year's. Although I had the whole year planned out, (at least an outline of it), I'm realizing after a couple of weeks, it needs a major revision.\nThese students are very anxious and chatty. Last year's group was not as big and more laid back. The pace I had originally planned to keep will have most of the students in this class falling behind and possibly even giving up, so something needs to change.\nPerhaps it would be advisable right now, to take out a unit and go deeper into the ones that are selected. This way there is less content, but the skills can still be covered inside of the topics used.\nStudents can get involved in order to make a decision about which unit changes or gets tossed.

Yes, I know what the kids need to learn by the end of the course, but how we get to that end point must be determined together with the students. I'm open to shift as needed.\nPacing learning is a huge part to teaching. It's something I've always had a challenge with, but over the years have made some progress.

The Blue Demons have reached the tournament 13 years in a row (and take pride in doing it) in a fun-to-watch style.\nIt\u2019s not fair to assume, however, that just because Bruno had success in his return that it will work out for Leitao. The men\u2019s and the women\u2019s game have certainly been on different paths results wise, and it\u2019s troubling for men\u2019s basketball due to the large importance to the university, given how it funds other sports.\nAccording to publicly made records, men\u2019s basketball in 2013 earned $6,282,582 in reported revenue while women\u2019s basketball took in $2,926,026. That amount was also the university\u2019s lowest amount of men\u2019s basketball team revenue since 2008 ($3,257,409).

Attendance has declined every year since 2007, when it fell from 10,145 to 9,262.\nLeitao is tasked with turning around a DePaul program that has lost at least 20 games in six of the last seven seasons. In the months since he was re-introduced to the DePaul community at a press conference, Leitao has spent time getting past first impressions and further trying to get to know his players.\nAnd for the most part, he\u2019ll be doing it with largely the same parts.\n11 of DePaul\u2019s 17 players are returning, most of whom are expected to be major contributors.\nIt\u2019s hard not to notice the emphasis on culture that Leitao has put on the first few months. When he spoke at the annual Chicago College Basketball luncheon in late October, Leitao stressed the micro-managing process in order to rebuild the DePaul program into something fans can be proud of.\nOf course, there\u2019s a reputation Leitao brings as well. His teams, from his previous three-year stint at DePaul to Virginia, have largely been known for their rebounding and their stout defense.\nBut stressing rebounding and defense is something that Purnell kept repeating also. It\u2019s one thing to talk about it, but another to put players in a better position to get rebounds or make defensive stops.\n\u201cMy first meeting with the coaching staff, I knew there was going to be a change,\u201d junior forward Tommy Hamilton IV said. \u201cFor the first time ever, I\u2019ve been on a staff that\u2019s hungry. Our practices are grit and bumping. We\u2019re getting a lot more after it. Before every practice, we have to run the mile. We\u2019re just trying to do everything before we\u2019re ready to go.\nThere is also a schematic defensive change that the Blue Demons will undergo. Purnell\u2019s ran a deny defense, but Leitao will utilize a \u201cpack-line\u201d defense, which emphasizes the ability to clog lanes and prevent dribble penetration through a sagging man-to-man defense.\nIt\u2019s unknown how the changes will impact DePaul, but it\u2019s the inconsistency in the group that needs to be fixed. Last season, the Blue Demons went a disappointing 6-6 in non-conference play before jumping out to a 5-2 record in the Big East. They finished the season, however, with losing 11 of their last 12 games. It was a group that showed flashes and some maddening tendencies.\nNCAA-quality team by developing an intense, high-pressure offense. In some ways, it\u2019s an opposite approach from Leitao.\nFor the women this season, though, one challenge will be to match the quality of offense from the past two seasons. They will be looking to replace the production of Brittany Hrynko, Megan Rogowski and Centrese McGee.\n\u201cWhat you did last year sets up a mindset of expectation \u2026 but you still have to put the ingridents together to make sure it comes out okay,\u201d he later added.\nBut for the most part, Bruno and his group are in a prime position to three-peat as Big East champions. He continues to make the most of his second opportunity at DePaul, heading into his 30th season.\nFor Leitao to make the most of his second chance, he said he has to change the culture."

Yet, knowing our habits and fully aware that this month officially contains the most depressing day of the year, BBC1 scheduled Surviving",
        "output": "Disaster \u2013 The Munich Air Crash on January 10, while Five drizzles John Barnes\u2019 Football Night at us every time we make it through to Friday.\nSurviving Disaster intercut dramatised scenes with contemporary footage to tell the story of the air crash that destroyed Matt Busby\u2019s first great side. Going very heavy on Dramatic Irony, various players tell wives they\u2019ll be back in three days, or ask girlfriends to meet them off the plane on Friday, and Matt Busby is asked to \u201cbring them back in one piece\u201d. Bearing in mind these were the pioneering days of European competition \u2013 and further bearing in mind United\u2019s plane to Bilbao had been forced to land in a field the previous year \u2013 we can be sure these kind of exchanges took place before Munich.\nHowever, cramming them all into three minutes of pre-flight dialogue and then scoring a bit of turbulence on the way to Belgrade with hysterical strings could be seen as overcooking the thing. When the United players enter their dressing room bantering in cheery but austere Fifties style, things steer dangerously close to an episode of Heartbeat, the jaw muscles preparing to clock off as we instinctively realise we don\u2019t have to think anymore. Then the actors running up the tunnel in bright red suddenly change into the real men in black and white running on to the pitch and the impact is immediate and painful. Surviving Disaster could have dwelt on the team\u2019s exploits before the crash and the rebuilding afterwards, but it only ever claimed to be a disaster reconstruction and, like all of its kind, succeeded by prodding the big sore point \u2013 the human fear that events in our universe are totally arbitrary and we are unregulated and unwatched.\nSpeaking of \u201cunwatched\u201d, I videotaped John Barnes\u2019 Football Night, but for some reason it didn\u2019t record. I definitely pressed the button and the red circle came on. I believe the machine rejected it.\nOn a more positive note, I\u2019d like to put forward Adrian Chiles as the most likeable person on television. In fact, with Peter Glaze dead and Sweep not doing so much TV work these days, there are surprisingly few contenders. Not only does Chiles get on very well with the more likeable panellists (Gordon Strachan, for example), Chiles is looked down upon on account of his lack of match experience by the less likeable ones (namely, school bully Hansen), a sure sign of the man\u2019s greatness. His curiosity \u2013 in itself, a trait unique in a football anchor \u2013 is aimed at players\u2019 and officials\u2019 human sides, leading him away from the traditional type of question (\u201cIs it too early to talk about this game being a six-pointer, Lawro?\u201d) that fill one with an unmasterable ennui on a weekly basis. When Chiles does run out of inspiration and comes out with a cliche, he has the decency to acknowledge the fact and deliver the thing in a bumbling fashion. This is the likeability of the man.\nIan Wright continues in his efforts, along with Lawro and Alan Hansen, to make the BBC\u2019s football panel the most relaxed in the land. At the Burton Albion FA Cup replay, Hansen gave his customary impersonation of a man waiting for a cab to take him to his proper job. Wright, meanwhile, reacted to Gary Lineker\u2019s first question by leaving it to Hansen and turning 90 degrees in his swivel chair to gaze out of the window. He repeated this behaviour several times, straining for the view below him when perhaps he might have been at least listening to Alan\u2019s answer if the question didn\u2019t interest him personally. Of course, Ian was the kind of child who wouldn\u2019t sit still on long car journeys and only coloured in one half of the clown\u2019s hair before wandering off to stare at a burst water main, but he\u2019s on television now in something approaching formal wear. He must surely learn to sit still for the ten minutes or so he has to be on camera. You can run around outside later, Ian, when boring old Lineker\u2019s pissed off to a Japanese restaurant.\nMy favourite sentence of the month appeared on the same transmission. Gary Lineker, introducing a report on the aftermath of Albion\u2019s draw with Man Utd, said: \u201cGarth Crooks enjoyed the euphoria.\u201d This is a fantastic word grouping. I have tried several times to visualise Garth Crooks enjoying the euphoria but I cannot do it. What Garth Crooks enjoys simply doesn\u2019t exist in nature."

For two men, in very different walks of life, it was the kindness of strangers that helped them survive the trauma of the day and of the intervening years.\nOn September 11, 2001, Patrick Anderson was in New York for a conference at the Marriott World Trade Center, the 22-storey hotel that sat between the famous Twin Towers. At 8:46 am, he was dressing for the day when the North Tower was hit by a hijacked airliner, American Airlines flight 11. Patrick was among the tens of thousands of people fleeing the complex when, at 9.03am, the South Tower was hit by a second hijacked plane, United Airlines flight 175.\nSeveral blocks away, an exhausted Patrick sought sanctuary in Stuyvesant High School, where pupils were gathered in caps and gowns for yearbook photographs. In this moment of isolation and despair, a stranger \u2013 Emily Maroney - approached him. Emily, the photographer\u2019s assistant, took Patrick\u2019s arm and told him he looked like he needed a hug.\nFor the next three hours, Emily took him under her wing as together they fled up the crowded West Highway, back to the studio where she worked. She shared her lunch with Patrick, then helped him make contact with his family and make a plan of where to go next. Only once she knew he was safe did she make her own way home.\nNow 58, Patrick has never forgotten Emily\u2019s kindness. He is wants to reconnect with her and find out what became of his Guardian Angel.\nAs Patrick Anderson was running for his life in New York, another horrific attack was unfolding in Washington DC: At 9:37am, a third hijacked plane was deliberately crashed into the Pentagon.\nJust a few miles away from the crash site, U.S. Army Chaplain Timothy Mallard was at home looking after his sick children when he heard the plane strike. In the days that followed, Timothy was assigned to provide pastoral care and support to the hundreds of soldiers and emergency workers at the crash site, including a FEMA team from Tennessee whose task was to make the building safe before recovering the victims.\nBy Timothy\u2019s fourth continuous day absorbing the grief of others, his own emotional wellbeing and faith was beginning to fail him. Following an impromptu service in the Pentagon grounds, he collapsed in a state of distress.\nJust at that moment, when it seemed his faith had deserted him, a fellow chaplain appeared by his side to offer words of comfort. Though they did not speak for long enough for Timothy to discover his name, he recalls that the Good Samaritan was a coastguard chaplain. His warm support gave Timothy the strength to continue his mission, not only at the Pentagon crash site but also in his army career since 2001, in which he served in both Afghanistan and Iraq.\nNow Timothy wants to meet the mystery minister again to thank him for giving him the strength to carry on."

        "output": "to explore.\nMotherhood has long been considered the embodiment of self-sacrifice, and for good reason. From the first manifestations of \u201cmorning\u201d sickness, sacrificial acts consume mothers, body and soul. Of course, it doesn\u2019t stop with pregnancy. Every stage of a child\u2019s life requires a different set of sacrifices, most of which are made willingly but pass unnoticed by their primary objects. The running joke is that the sacrifices of motherhood run so deep, they even affect the brain: \u201cInsanity is hereditary,\u201d goes one adage; \u201cyou inherit it from your children.\u201d More than one mother has, at one time or another, ruefully (perhaps even proudly) pointed to her children as being responsible for what she considers a decline in her mental capacities.\nFortunately, however, research may have uncovered just the right information to distract us from obsessing about our sacrifices long enough to consider some of the things we might actually be gaining from motherhood.\nIn this vein Katherine Ellison, author of The Mommy Brain: How Motherhood Makes Us Smarter (2005), brought welcome news to mothers everywhere. It\u2019s true, she acknowledges: we mothers have long perpetuated the notion that having babies zaps our brain cells. This notion finally became so entrenched, she informed Vision recently, that dozens of scientists set out to discover whether it is actually true. And the truth is? It is not.\nIn fact, she found, study after study shows that having babies contributes to increased brain cells, and along with these little darlings (the new brain cells as well as the babies) come increased skills of all kinds.\nAt the center of this good news is that now-familiar phenomenon, neurogenesis: the brain\u2019s process of growing and changing through the development of new neurons. This amazing brain plasticity is encouraged by repeated new actions, especially of the \u201cpositive, emotionally charged, and challenging\u201d variety, referred to by scientists as \u201cenrichment.\u201d As it turns out, the process of child rearing, beginning even in pregnancy, is enrichment\u2019s mother lode. The abundant variety of intense new experiences forced on us mothers by daily interaction with our children strengthens much more than our flexibility and our multitasking skills. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) reveals increases in a long list of areas, including (but not limited to) emotional intelligence, sensory powers, mental perception, motivation, attention, problem solving, prioritizing, memory and learning. And the gains are not temporary. In fact, indications are that the positive changes brought about in the brain by pregnancy hormones, and subsequent stimulation from our babies and children, last for the rest of our lives\u2014long past the time our grandchildren are born.\nDespite the role of pregnancy-induced hormones in this brain-enriching experience, the good news is not only for mothers. Research is hinting that the benefits of child care may turn out to be a \u201cfather lode\u201d as well.\nCiting research on rodents, Ellison remarks that \u201cmodern, engaged dads may be gaining some of the same learning and memory advantages from parenthood as have been found in maternal rats. The key appears to be the degree of involvement with the children.\u201d Further, she notes the documented rise of certain \u201cparenting\u201d hormones in men when their wives are pregnant, and points to the well-known phenomenon called Couvades syndrome, in which \u201csympathy morning sickness\u201d and \u201csympathy weight gain\u201d are factors.\nIf, as scientists speculate, these physiological changes are brought about by the exchange of pheromones between pregnant mothers and fathers, it may be one more benefit to be gained from the cultivation of close family relationships.\nEllison\u2019s thoughtful collection of research certainly dispatches the sometimes popular notion that raising a child is \u201cless worthy\u201d work for intelligent people. In fact, it\u2019s beginning to look like one of the best avenues for becoming a creative human being.\nPerhaps motherhood is, after all, its own reward.\nKatherine Ellison, The Mommy Brain: How Motherhood Makes You Smarter (2005).\nJohn Fauber, \u201cAnimal Studies Show Fathers Mimic Pregnancy Symptoms,\u201d JSOnline (Feb 3, 2006).\nCraig Howard Kinsley and Kelly G.

        "output": "High School.\nThe loss ended Middletown\u2019s season and propelled Cheshire into the state Super Regional opening at Middletown\u2019s Palmer Field Saturday.\nAfter spotting Cheshire a 2-0 first-inning lead, Middletown grabbed the lead scoring three times in the second inning. But Cheshire scored three in the third to take a 5-3 lead, and didn\u2019t give it back. The 75ers got a run in the third -- they should have had more -- to make it a 5-4 game going to the fifth.\nThat\u2019s where Cheshire -- the visiting team in this game -- broke it open.\nThe zone champs scored seven runs to take an overwhelming 12-4 lead and although Cheshire\u2019s relief pitching was spotty, it was good enough to hold off the 75ers.\nCheshire rapped 11 hits in three innings off Middletown started Jared Pflaumer before D\u2019Aquila replaced him with Austin Rak, who restored order to the proceedings with a 1-2-3 fourth.\nRak wasn\u2019t so lucky in the fifth.\nRak walked the first two hitters, then gave up a single to Nick Sansone (3-for-4) to load the bases. Dom Shumilla then smacked a two-run double for two runs. D\u2019Aquila replaced Rak with Dan Botti who fared no better.\nBotti immediately gave up an RBI single to Ben DeLaubell (4-for-5) and after he walked Adam von Fischer, Pat Downey (2-for-4) singled in a run. After a ground ball out, Brendan Clark (2-for-3) boomed a two-run double before Botti got the third out.\nMiddletown put a lot of runners on base over the next three innings, but managed only four runs. Of more importance, the 75ers couldn\u2019t keep Cheshire from tacking on runs.\nMiddletown loaded the bases with nobody out in the fifth but got just one run on an infield out by Keith LaChance. The 75ers loaded the bases with two out in the sixth and got two runs, one when Nevin Sanchez (2-for-2) was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded to force in a run and the second on an RBI single by Billy Egan.\nAgain Middletown loaded the bases with nobody out in the seventh, but got just one run on a bouncer by Colin Horn. The 75ers stranded 12 runners.\nCheshire tacked on three in the seventh off Sebby Amenta and Nick Brenchak with all three runs scoring on bases-loaded walks.\nAfter Cheshire (21-6, 24-7 overall) scored two in the first on four singles, with RBI hits by Downey and Clark, Middletown took the lead with three in the second.\nKeith LaChance singled home two runs and Jake Alonzo (2-for-5) knocked in another with a base hit. But a two-run single by Sansone and an RBI single by Jay Strollo (3-for-5) gave Cheshire a lead in the third inning, a lead it wouldn\u2019t give up, although it tried.\nIn the home third, Pflaumer (2-for-5) singled with one out. But he was picked off by starter Mike Hickey. That pickoff was followed by a double from Nick Brenchak (1-for-2, a walk, twice hit by pitches), an RBI double by Sanchez and a walk to Jack Higgs.\nBut that rally ended when LaChance flied to center.\n\u201cCheshire is a pretty good team,\u201d D\u2019Aquila said. \u201cTheir center fielder [Strollo] is very good; hardly anything falls in with him and overall their defense is good. They have good pitching, although they put maybe a few too many on base which might hurt them as they go deeper, but they have a lot of arms.\nHickey went only four innings so did not qualify for the win. Of the three other pitchers, only Adler Demac -- the second pitcher -- pitched reasonably well, so he got the win.\nAll 23 runs were earned as there were no errors/passed balls in the game.\nMiddletown finished with an overall record of 17-24."

In total, \u20ac1.6 million was allotted for the reconstruction and re-furbishing of the National Sports Complex in Osrblie from the finances of the Education Ministry (which also has sports under its remit) and the prime minister.\nL\u00ed\u0161ka was detained by police in July 2011 when he was caught accepting marked banknotes worth \u20ac30,000 at the office of Novotn\u00fd, who was in the US at that time.\nBoth Novotn\u00fd and L\u00ed\u0161ka claim they are innocent. L\u00ed\u0161ka\u2019s lawyer even said that nothing has proved that the money they were discussing over the phone was a bribe, as reported by the TASR newswire.\nThe original verdict in the case, which found four men (L\u00ed\u0161ka, Novotn\u00fd, plus builder Peter K\u0148az\u00edk and mediator Pavol Pre\u010duch) in the case guilty, was issued on October 10, 2013 as part of the penalty notice. In addition to L\u00ed\u0161ka and Novotn\u00fd\u2019s sentences and fines, K\u0148az\u00edk and Pre\u010duch were given conditional sentences of nine months and six months, respectively.

        "input": "Is the Internet broken? According to some, it may be. A newly discovered bug dubbed Heartbleed is capturing attention. As each hour passes, more information is revealed. With the desire to provide useful insights, the tech world - and even the mainstream media - is awash with stories.\nSometimes it\u2019s hard",
        "output": "to cut through the flood of technical information to get a solid sense of what needs to be done. The challenge is distilling down to the actions we need to take for our organizations, ourselves, and how to guide those we serve.\nTransport Layer Security (TLS) is broadly used to encrypt and protect information in transit. The Heartbleed bug allows an attacker to gain access to the memory, siphoning off whatever happens to be stored: usernames, passwords, credit card information, and even the private keys of the server.\nThe popular comic xkcd explained the bug brilliantly today (see it here).\nThe way we respond and communicate with people has a direct impact on trust. It's imperative we get this right.\nNote: Canada shut down the tax system in response to Heartbleed. The Canadian tax deadline is April 30. That means they made a nearly impossible decision during the busiest time of the year. They even shut down additional sites/systems this morning and plan to test and verify the elements. It's a courageous decision designed to maintain trust and ensure people are not at risk.\nEspecially now that US Regulators have started to warn banks. They've even suggested banks should encourage their customers to change passwords (I heard the collective groan - see below for ideas).\nIt's possible that organizations that fail to act may be liable in the future. It's too soon to tell, for certain. The responsible action is to follow the actions below and avoid serving as the test case.\nUse this as a checklist to make sure your team took these actions. Or share it with your executives to show them the steps you took (and why). Then use it as a guideline for how to break it down and explain this to the people we serve.\nThe specifics of the bug impact the TLS protocol with the heartbeat extension (hence the name Heartbleed). Initial coverage and focus was on the sheer number of Internet servers using openSSL and the large potential risk this bug poses.\nIntroduced into the code over two years ago and somewhat difficult to detect (in many circumstances), we need to assume in most cases that any system or device running a vulnerable version of openSSL over might have been compromised.\nThe latest reports confirm this bug impacts hardware and software in a whole range of commercial and open source solutions, including routers, virtual servers, and popular software packages like Tor (https://blog.torproject.org/).\nAnticipate more reports with more devices - including purpose built solutions and industrial control systems to be next.\nConsider the elements on your network, in your systems, and part of your solutions. Recognize that sometimes the elements that rely on openSSL is not always evident. When in doubt (and it's good to be a bit doubtful), test. When testing, check interconnected systems.\nMost Internet-facing servers are designed to be patched. And most already have patches available. However, given the growing nature of affected systems and devices, it may take a few days before patches are ready for some devices and solutions. That requires a combination of diligence and patience.\nOften patches are applied without the need to restart machines and services. In this case, some reports have surfaced where people need to restart. The key is to test and verify the success of applied patches.\nIn the rare circumstance where patching isn't possible, gather the team to assess and plan. If you run into one of these situations, reach out for help.\nThis is key (no pun intended). This is also an area a lot of people are likely to overlook or, worse, skip because they think they weren't affected.\nBottom line: the bug has been in the code for two years; assume the certificate is compromised.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not going to get a new cert, you\u2019re missing the point of this bug,\u201d explained Jason Soroko, Head of Malware Research, Entrust - A Datacard Company.\nThe fix isn\u2019t complete until the cert is revoked and re-issued.\nIn the event you captured and kept TLS logs, take time to review the logs and look for signs of compromise. If the logs aren't available, minimally assess if/how/why people need to change their passwords. Determine what, if any, other information could have been compromised or impacted.\nClear and transparent communication is key to trust. When explaining the situation, outline the steps you took and confirm you revoked and replaced the certificates. Explain any potential impacts. Ars Technica is an example of an excellent announcement (read it here).\nWe\u2019re already seeing signs of \u201cyup, we patched\u201d surface. The problem is those messages fail to inspire the confidence that they revoked the old certs and issued and installed new certs.\nTake the time to craft the message that explains understanding of the risk and the appropriate actions taken.\nDepends on the size of the organization and the size of your traffic. Large, heavily trafficked sites are already updated(or should be). You may fall into that category. Use this checklist to confirm and review the actions of the team.\nSmaller sites may take longer to assess and act. Some sites rely on third parties and organizations to maintain their sites. It is important that they understand and follow the five steps outlined above. Based on workload and the time to get the certs revoked and reissued, it may be a few days or weeks.\nKeep in mind that in all cases, it is important to review partners and interconnected systems.\nWhile this is widely reported as potentially impacting two-thirds of Internet-facing servers, some sites do not rely on or use openSSL. Those sites may not be vulnerable. The majority of sites, however, do use openSSL and either need to patch it or they already did.\nOne way to find out is to run a test using a website or browser plugin (a quick search reveals 2-3 popular options). At this point, these checks look to see if the site uses -- and patched -- open SSL, but not necessarily if the certificate was reissued.\nI chose not to share the links because in some cases, their use could be deemed illegal (read here). We\u2019ll need to explore this more in the near future. In the meantime, an alternative for checking large/popular sites is to check one of the public lists of updated websites maintained by several tech sites.\nThe complete fix requires revocation and re-issue of server certificates. If a site passes the check for updating the patch, it is still importance to check for a currently re-issued cert (after April 7, 2014).\nExplaining this to less technically savvy people is likely to be a challenge. Ideally, someone develops an automated method to check for the patch *and* the certificate replacement. (Update: looks like LassPass offers this checking for their users. No endorsement, but I hope others do this, too).\nIn the meantime, Soroko suggests checking and making sure that certificate revocation checking is turned on in whatever browser you use.\nScout for phishing emails masquerading as Heartbleed password change notices. If unsure, type the URL for the site by hand.\nKeep in mind that if you have shared or reused passwords across sites (and one of them was or may have been affected), then both need to change. It's a good opportunity to build, manage, and use better passwords; unique for each site.\nWhat is the reasonable timeframe (for personal action)?\nIt seems reasonable to prioritize based on site, use, and purpose. Anything relied on or with financial information takes a higher priority.\nIn my case, I have over 600 passwords stored in my password manager. As sites apply the patch and re-issue their certificates over the next few weeks, I will slowly work through my passwords and make changes.\nA little bit at time makes a big difference.\nHeartbleed poses a series of challenges when it comes to communicating with others. It caught frenetic mainstream attention during the early stages of assessing and understanding the impact. It gives new meaning to the phrase, \u201cif it bleeds, it leads\" if only because of the name.\nCouple that with the reality that much of the advice is similar to what our colleagues have heard for the last two decades. That means just telling people to \u201cchange their passwords, avoid clicking on links, and use caution on the Internet,\u201d is basically noise easily tuned out.\nThe good news is that in every organizational assessment and analysis I've completed over the last decade, the internal security team is regarded as a trusted source of information. It means we have some real opportunities here. To rethink how we approach and provide guidance. Given the hype and coverage of Heartbleed, we need to provide measured, sound advice.\nTaking the time to translate complexity into understanding creates a stronger security culture.\nOur colleagues and clients use our resources, and often use the same credentials on other sites. More than suggesting that they change passwords is the importance of explaining why the timing of the change matters.\nRevisit how we explain the elements of TLS (https://), how to examine the certificates from the browser (and why they might want to). Share why it makes sense (instead of simply telling them) to manually type in the URL they want to visit if they are uncertain if the site is safe.\nInvite people into the conversation and be prepared to answer questions in a way that makes sense; if you don't know the answer, offer to get back to them. Done right, this leads to a higher level of awareness (see the definition) and a step toward stronger relationships and more security-conscious actions.\nWhen Heartbleed winds down, we need to collectively step back and reassess the challenges and opportunities of the industry. We need to explore the challenges we really need to solve.\nIn the meantime, focus on the five actions for each organization and three steps each of us needs to take. As this unfolds, we'll continue to look for ways to engage and advance the conversation."

        "output": "retreat of the Kennedy family. From Hyannis, ride on the Steamship Authority's ferry to Nantucket. All this costs just $50, and it only takes four hours to get there.\nIf you want to skip the ferry, you can fly from Hyannis for around $50 on one of a handful of small airlines which service Nantucket. Round-trip flights from Boston are also available at a significantly higher price.\nAnd while you can't go swimming at the white-sand beaches yet, many of the island's museums and historical attractions are open for business.\nJust walking the historic town area is a treat in itself. Grab a turkey sandwich at Henry's (right near the ferry dock) and wander the cobblestone streets which wind narrow ways dotted with wooden houses with widows' walks. Stop for coffee at Cafe Espresso on Main Street or dodge into The Hub, the town's newsstand, to grab a copy of an island newspaper.\nCenter Street (once called Petticoat Lane because all its businesses were run by women whose husbands were off hunting whales in the Pacific) is home to many wonderful art galleries, among them the Sailor's Valentine Gallery, which specializes in \"art brut,\" or outsider art.\nOn the corner of Center and Broad is the Jared Coffin House, a wonderful old red brick inn renovated in 1963. Jared's features a delicious fresh seafood buffet on Sunday evenings.\nToward the water is the Old South Wharf, featuring specialty shops that sell everything from miniature porcelain dolls to specialty print shops.\nIf you follow the Makadet Road out of town, it will take you all the way to one of the island's farthest ends. You can branch off half way and head to the Dionis Beach or continue on the rest of the way.\nThe road eventually ends at Madaket, a small village at the islands west-most end. The houses are mostly grey-shingled salt-box homes, no more than 25 feet high.\nOther destinations out of town include the popular Surfside Beach, which is crowded on the weekends. The Sankaty Head Light, an historic lighthouse, and the Life Saving Museum are also island attractions worth seeing.\nAt Nantucket's east-most point is the town of Siasconset (called 'Sconset by all the locals). This is really a small town within the larger town of Nantucket. Artists and literati are often seen here. Street painters can also be spotted out in front of the bookstore or around the small post office which marks the way to the beach.\nFor night life, the best bet is to go to the White Elephant Hotel, just two blocks off Broad Street on the water, to hear the piano player. In the summer, musicians Jim Badger has islanders and tourists alike rolling with his music and wit.\nOut of town there are a few clubs. The best is The Box, on Dave Street across from the Finast supermarket (21 and over only, please). The Muse on Athletic Ave. also features live music.\nOne more thing, though--there's a pretty good chance it will be rainy or foggy when you visit. It's rainy and foggy for most of March on Nantucket. (That's why the island is called \"the grey lady\" by some.) So bring your rain gear and good cheer. Hey, it may be raining, but you're in Nantucket, not Cambridge. Enjoy the escape."

Let\u2019s take a look at one of those approaches,",
        "output": "called \u201ccontainers\u201d, and see how it measures up vs. the current industry standard set by sandboxes.\nContainment is a fairly new concept, deviating from the widely known and popular \u201csandboxing\u201d method. Sandboxing is a detection method which scans potentially malicious files in a confined area/an isolated environment, otherwise known as the \u201csandbox\u201d, to determine if it is indeed malware. Sandboxing arose as a response to the realization that signature-based technology had grown increasingly ineffective in protecting endpoints from stealth attacks.\nSandboxing, however, once the \u201cgo-to\u201d solution for thwarting unknown threats, is also gradually proving insufficient in today\u2019s increasingly sophisticated malware climate, echoing the challenge IT security execs faced with the inadequacy of signatures.\nEnter the next generation, virtual containers. Virtual containers reside on the endpoint and continuously isolate applications like web browsers, email and removable storage that come into contact with untrusted sources. Unlike sandboxes, containers are not a time-limited solution for testing whether code is malicious. Instead, they provide an ongoing buffer between the \u201cinsecure\u201d realm of the internet and the \u201csecure\u201d realm of the corporate network.\nSeveral years ago, sandboxing became the popular approach to detecting advanced threats, causing several big-name security companies to advocate this as the preferred method. Sandboxes do not continuously run on endpoints, rather they generally run on a server and are used to detonate a suspicious file. Files are opened there first, and if they don\u2019t trigger any alarms after a short time, they are sent onward.\nThe sandbox is in action for a short period of time, scanning any unknown content and detecting malware. However, once this process is completed, the approved content is free to transfer over into the trusted network. Malicious content, unfortunately, is \u201csmart\u201d and is known to disguise itself as benign until the testing period is over. Following the testing period, the malware is released and a phenomenon known as \u201csandbox evasion\u201d occurs.\nSandboxing and containers have their similarities - they both use virtualization to create a \u201csafe space\u201d for potentially malicious content. But, as hackers focus on devising attack methods that we haven\u2019t thought of, making them impossible to detect, containers take the approach that everyone is suspect.\nThe security architecture of containers, as opposed to sandboxes, is designed to outsmart malware evasion. With containers, detection is not essential. Instead, both non-malicious and malicious content remain in the container forever.\nContainers have evolved out of the need for a more comprehensive solution, one that will create a sort of perimeter around any application that can be used as an attack vector, constantly running, isolating all unknown content, and maintaining constant segregation from trusted networks. A container runs continuously on the endpoint and rather than isolating a file for a short time, it isolates the risky application, like the web browser or email or Skype continuously. Container technology can be implemented in software, on top of the operating system, or as part of the microprocessor\u2019s firmware.\nContainers assume anything unknown is untrusted and, therefore, keeps it in a secure and isolated environment, known as the \u201ccontainer\u201d. Anything unknown is eternally deemed untrusted and can only leave the container through a secure bridge that disarms threats and gives security teams control over what enters the corporate network.\nWith 44% of respondents in a recent SANS endpoint security survey admitting that one or more of their endpoints had been compromised in the past 24 months, 2016 will see more money invested in endpoint security\u2014a market growing at a CAGR of 8.4% from 2015 to 2020.\nWhile server-based file sandboxing has been successful in stopping many threats, today\u2019s sophisticated malware attacks demand a more comprehensive solution. Just as malware has evolved and taken on different forms, sandboxing, as well, is assuming different forms, including virtual containers, and micro-virtualization solutions that provide continuous protection. This more comprehensive approach ensures that any threat that gets in \u2013 whether through a web browser, email, document, phone etc. will be locked in a container indefinitely.\nIf we want to prevent the next data breach from happening, we must offer solutions that provide a solid defense, along with seamless deployment and management. Conventional sandboxing has an important role to play in terms of testing suspicious executables in a safe environment. But it is no longer effective in preventing unknown threats as containers continuously isolate risky applications, do not rely on detection and provide a more effective long-term solution for user endpoints from whatever hackers come up with next."

        "output": "however, in other regions, many countries have resisted that trend, welcoming new generations of just-as-eager Christians and Muslim believers, according to a Pew Research Center report released today.\nOf the 106 countries in the report, more than half (58 nations) show little or no age gap in religious commitment. In the rest (46 nations), adults under 40 were significantly less likely than their elders to consider religion very important.\nParticularly religious countries with higher population growth tend to maintain religious belief and commitment between young and old generations. Pew found that over the past decade these highly religious countries outpaced their less religious counterparts due to high fertility rates and disproportionately young populations, factors often tied to their level of development.\nWorldwide, 90 percent of adults over the age of 40 affiliate with a religious tradition, compared to 85 percent of those under 40, Pew reported.\nIn North America and Western Europe, where secularization has accelerated the most, the difference in religious affiliation between today\u2019s young adults and their elders is pretty stark\u2014two to five times wider than the global age gap.\nCanada has the biggest generational religious divide in the world. The difference between Canadian young adults and their elders who affiliate with a particular religion is 28 percentage points.\nOther top countries for gaps in religious affiliation include Denmark (26 percentage points), South Korea (24 percentage points), Australia (23 percentage points), and Norway and Sweden (both 20 percentage points).\nThough adults in the United States are about twice as likely (53%) as those in Canada (27%) to describe religion as very important in their lives, the US isn\u2019t much further down the list. Its age gap in religious affiliation is 17 percentage points.\nWhile the Americas and much of Europe showcase the religious contrast between young and old, the Middle East and Africa see little, if any, difference in affiliation across age groups. They\u2019re also the regions where religious commitment is strongest in the first place.\nTwo majority Christian countries represent the biggest exceptions to the religious age gap seen around the globe. In Ghana, a relatively stable country in West Africa, and Georgia, a former Soviet republic, today\u2019s young people are more likely than older generations to say religion is \u201cvery important\u201d in their lives, the report stated.\nFor example, 91 percent of Ghanaians under 40, compared to 85 percent of older Ghanaians, named religion is very important in their lives.\nIn three other African nations\u2014Liberia, Rwanda, and Chad\u2014and the Orthodox Christian state of Armenia, young adults claim their religious affiliation, attend services, and commit to daily prayer at higher rates than their parents and grandparents. Liberia, Rwanda, and Armenia are mostly Christian, while Chad is majority-Muslim, with a significant Christian minority of over 40 percent.\nGhana and Chad are the only two countries where young adults are more likely than their elders to identify with their religion.\nPew suggests one explanation for these handful of countries where young adults are not only as faithful as their elders, but more so: violent conflict.\nCountries with Christian majorities and those with Muslim majorities tend toward different kinds of religious gaps between young and old.\nIn predominantly Christian countries, it\u2019s whether they consider religion a priority; the greatest generational discrepancies emerge over the question of religion\u2019s importance in their lives. In predominantly Muslim countries, it\u2019s a question of mosque attendance. Even in countries where religiosity remains steady across age groups, young people still tend to be less likely to pray daily.\nChristian-majority countries face the biggest decrease in religiosity among youths, with about half reporting that religion is less important to younger Christian adults. Muslim-majority countries face a similar dilemma, though not as severe, with about a quarter showing a similar drop in religious commitment among young people.\nEspecially in the West, these trends may point to a more secular generation of young people, but some analysts hold that people tend to become more religious as they get older.\nAs noted, the countries with the greatest percentage of people who say religion is \u201cvery important\u201d in their lives\u2014mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and Central America\u2014are also among the fastest-growing countries in the world.\nThe Pew report points out a negative correlation between religious commitment and various development factors, such as levels of education, gross domestic product (GDP), and income equality.\nThat is, countries with widespread education and high wages are typically less religious by traditional measures. Less developed countries\u2014with relatively poorer education and less wealthy populations\u2014generally have more religious populations.\nThere is, however, one serious outlier in this trend: the United States.\n\u201cOf 102 countries, the US is the only one with both above-average GDP per capita and above-average frequency of daily prayer,\u201d stated the Pew researchers. Other measures of religious commitment are considerably higher in the United States than in other developed nations.\nChristianity Today has reported on earlier Pew Research examining Americans\u2019 efforts to pass their faith along to their children amid a secularizing culture as well as how Christian and Muslim birth rates will alter the global religious landscape in the coming decades.\nDeadly disease brings a bit more accuracy to much-maligned Band Aid advocacy song."

As part of the deal, Russia agreed to cut its production by 230,000 million barrels per day (bpd) from the 11.41 bpd touched in October.\nBut the latest OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR) forecast that Russia will not fully comply with the cuts agreement during the first half of 2019.

During the OPEC meeting in Vienna in December 2018, Rosneft announced that its oil output forecasts for the first six months of 2019 remain unchanged.\nThat is mainly because Rosneft aims to increase production from three new fields it launched in Siberia in 2018. This led some market participants to question not only Russia\u2019s compliance with the new OPEC+ agreement, but also that of other non-OPEC producers.\nMarket participants are confused by some of the statements from Russia with regard to energy policy and compliance with OPEC+ output cuts.

        "output": "about options. Instead of making specific recommendations for tax reform, we chose to highlight the broad range of possibilities for raising new revenues and reducing inequality. We see this as the start of a broad, thoughtful and realistic conversation about how we all, as citizens of this province, can work together to meet our pressing challenges and strengthen our communities.\nI think we can all agree that without more revenues, we can't sustain key services we all rely on, let alone begin to meaningfully tackle the pressing challenges of climate change, income inequality and poverty.\nThe good news, as our research shows, is that B.C. has a lot of room to raise new revenues. For example, if B.C. collected the same amount of personal income tax (incl. MSP) as the average for other Canadian provinces, we'd have an additional $2.4 billion in revenues.\nWe believe that all parts of the tax system should be on the table as we look for a way to get out of this budget crunch, create the fiscal room to meet our pressing needs and make the tax system more fair. This is why, while our report focuses on personal income tax reform (the most progressive part of the system), we also highlight options for reform to property tax, corporate taxes and resource royalties.\nIf we increased the current top tax bracket tax rate from 14.7 per cent to 17 per cent, and added two new upper-income brackets (20 per cent on income of $150,000-$200,000 and 22 per cent on income over $200,000), we could raise $930 million. This would be enough to fund a much-needed increase to welfare rates (frozen since 2007), restore class sizes, composition and specialist teacher staffing to 2007 levels and fund additional family support programs under the Ministry of Children and Family development.\nWhile the B.C. government boasts about having low taxes in their TV ads, our province faces a crisis in seniors care, our hospitals are overcrowded, our schools cannot afford to provide children with learning disabilities and other special needs the supports they need to learn well. A decade of tax cuts has left us in the absurd situation of having the highest poverty rate in Canada, but some of the lowest income taxes for the highest income earners (we have the lowest income tax for those earning up to $120,000, the second lowest up to $340,000 and the third lowest up to $730,000).\nYes, we are talking about increasing taxes, but this should come with tax reform that will spread the tax bill more fairly. We're now facing the absurd reality of a tax system where the higher your income, the lower your total provincial tax rate when all personal taxes are considered (income, sales, property, carbon tax and MSP premiums).\nOver the last decade, taxes have been shifted from corporations to families, and from upper-income families to middle- and modest-income ones. Cuts to personal income taxes delivered large savings to high earners (an average of $41,000 per year for a family in the top 1 per cent). In contrast, most B.C. families' tax cut worked out to a few hundred dollars a year, most of which went to cover increased MSP premiums, and higher out-of-pocket fees for a host of programs, including school fundraisers, fees for seniors care, tuition for students and many more.\nOur report shows that if most people pitched in the cost of a cup of coffee a day (meaning $200 - $800 per year for at least 80 per cent of British Columbians), with high earners contributing more, we could raise up to $2.3 billion -- enough to strengthen our communities and build a province we can all be proud of."

Health care",
        "output": "costs in the U.S. have been growing faster than inflation for more than three decades. There is little relief in sight. A Willis Towers Watson study found that U.S. employers expect their health care costs to increase by 5.5% in 2018, up from a 4.6% increase in 2017. The study projects an average national cost per employee of $12,850. The three companies have a combined workforce of 1.2 million. Based on the Willis Towers Watson estimate, they could spend more than $15 billion on employee health care this year.\nBut, what can the alliance do about it? On that, Buffett was less clear: \u201cOur group does not come to this problem with answers. But, we also do not accept it is inevitable,\u201d he said.\nThe challenge is formidable. As the New York Times noted, employers have banded together before to address health care costs and failed to make much of a dent in health care spending. How will this effort be different?\nIf this alliance as simply another employer purchasing cooperative, it will probably have little effect. Neither 1.2 million employees nor $15 billion in spending is all that significant in a 300M person, $3.2 trillion US health care market. It might nudge the health care industry towards incrementally faster, better and cheaper health care innovations\u2014but not much more.\nIf, however, the alliance thinks big and structures itself as a testbed for potentially transformative ideas, innovations and businesses, it could have a disruptive effect.\nAmazon is the critical ingredient in this latter approach. While all three companies bring employees and resources (both critical), only Amazon brings particularly relevant technological prowess and disruptive innovation experience.\nAmazon could think big by simply applying the standard operating principles and capabilities that is has perfected for retail\u2014comprehensive data, personalization, price and quality transparency, operational excellence, consumer focus and high satisfaction\u2014to health care. It also has differentiated technologies like Alexa, mobile devices, cloud (AWS) and AI expertise. It could leverage its recent years of health-care-specific exploration, such as those in cardiovascular health, diabetes management, pharmacies, pharmacy benefit management, digital health and other health care research. It could use Whole Foods as a physical point of presence.\nAmazon could then start small and learn fast. It could crunch the numbers and come up with large enough interesting employee segments for experimentation. For example, it might focus on improving quality and satisfaction for the sickest 1-2% of employees. It might focus on those with hypertension or diabetes. It might focus on helping those undergoing specific treatments, such as orthopedics or cancer. It might focus on preventing the rise of chronic diseases in those at most risk, such as those with prediabetes or uncontrolled hypertension. It might focus on narrow but high impact issues, like price transparency or prescription adherence. Issues in privacy would have be addressed but there are many opportunities to address well-known but as yet unsolved problems in health care.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean, however, that profits are not possible in the future. Amazon built its AWS cloud computing business by first solving an internal problem in a plug compatible, low cost and scalable manner, and then bringing it to the market. That business building approach would provide an additional incentive that goes beyond cost cutting: a new business platform for Amazon, an enormous investment opportunity for Berkshire and (despite short term consternation to existing clients) investment banking opportunities for JPMorgan.\nIn Parts 2 and 3 of this series, I will explore what an Amazon inspired transformation in health care might look like and how Amazon is well-positioned to make it happen."

The next state support scheme provides for BDZ to receive hundreds of millions of concessions at Sofia Airport.\nThe forecast for the necessary investments is part of a BDZ technological update report, developed by 3 universities - UNWE, the Technical Uni and Higher Transport School, together with experts from the Ministry of Transport, BDZ and NRIC. \"This document has looked at all possible aspects of what the BDZ train fleet should look like in the next few years, what should be its common technical parameters, what kind of passenger traffic BDZ can win after improving its competitiveness on the market and what comfort it needs \"On this basis, the collegues from\" Passenger Transport \"are ready to launch a public procurement for the supply of new modular trains,\" Vladimirov told Focus.\nThe project for the technological renovation of the railway has two stages. During the first phase it is planned to buy 41 modular trains, which will cost at least BGN 380 mln. During the second stage, 44 more compositions have to be delivered. It is expected that the first new trains will be on the rails of Bulgaria by 2020. \"It is necessary to take decisions at the government level in order to provide funds for the second stage,\" said BDZ chief.\nHe noted that BDZ is confidently on the way to clearing debts, a very heavy burden on the railway, and more than BGN 600 million have been deducted to date to cover these debts and any additional costs associated with them. By the end of 2018 the debt crisis of the railroads will end, Vladimirov is convinced."

        "output": "with performance or battery life.\nWhen we reviewed the Gateway M250E a year ago, we liked everything about the laptop, save its lackluster application performance. We feel roughly the same about the Gateway M255-E, which features a handful of minor design improvements, a Core 2 Duo processor, and less-than-stellar benchmark results. It will ably handle the rigors of business-class computing, but it failed to set the world on fire on CNET Labs' new benchmarks. With integrated graphics and no option for upgrading to a dedicated graphics card, the Gateway M255-E's performance potential is limited; your best bet for improving performance is adding more memory. Alternatively, if you are comfortable choosing an off-brand, the $1,499 PC Club Enpower ENP680 provides more features and better performance for less dough.\nThe M255-E is sold via Gateway's small-business site; the consumer equivalent is the NX260X, which lacks a TPM security chip but provides a consumer diagnostic tool called BigFix, which Gateway inherited from eMachines. The system features Gateway's tried-and-true silver-and-black color scheme but measures slightly wider and thicker than the previous M250E at 13.3 inches wide, 9.7 inches deep, and 1.3 inches thick. It weighs a hefty 6.2 pounds--heavier than the older M250E. The small, two-prong power adapter adds 0.8 pound to your travel bag. On the whole, its design is superior to that of the PC Club Enpower ENP680; not only does the Gateway present a more polished, professional appearance, but it also feels sturdier and more solidly built.\nThe 14.1-inch screen features a 1,280x800 native resolution. Business users will appreciate the absence of the Utlrabright glossy coating; while it makes movies and photos stand out--particularly in a dark room or an airplane cabin--the coating causes glare and reflection problems under normal working conditions. The keyboard retains the same, comfortable design of the M250E, and the touch pad is wider and deeper. The mouse keys have been improved; they are larger and easier to use than the M250E's narrow, firm keys. Other features we wish we saw on last year's models have been added, including Bluetooth, an S-Video port, and the TPM chip. One feature we are sad to see go is the old unit's volume dial on the front edge; you'll need to use function keys to adjust the volume on the M255-E.\nThe front edge supplies a multiformat media card reader and headphone and microphone jacks. The system features four USB ports, conveniently split between the left and right sides. A four-pin FireWire port and a modem jack flank the USB ports on the right edge, while S-Video and VGA connectors do the same on the left. An 8X double-layer DVD burner hides along the left side, as well. An Ethernet port is the only connection on the back edge other than the power. The integrated wireless chip supports 802.11 a/b/g networking.\nOur review unit came equipped with a Core 2 Duo T5600 processor. It's the second-lowest chip in the line with a clock speed of 1.83GHz and 2MB of L2 cache. Rounding out the specs are 1GB of fast 667MHz DDR2 memory, an 80GB 7,200rpm Hitachi hard drive, and integrated Intel 945GM graphics. The PC Club Enpower ENP680 trumps these specs by including a faster Core 2 Duo processor (with double the L2 cache), twice the memory, and an Nvidia GeForce Go 7600 GS graphics card that supplies 256MB of dedicated video RAM.\nWe weren't surprised to see the PC Club Enpower ENP680 top the Gateway M255-E on CNET Labs' new benchmarks; it bested the Gateway on our Multitasking, Photoshop, and iTunes tests. More surprising was the fact that the M255-E lost badly to two previous-generation Core Duo-based laptops from Dell and HP on the Photoshop test. The scores make sense when you consider that our Photoshop test is memory intensive and that the Gateway M255-E supplies only half the memory of the Dell Inspiron E1505 and the HP Pavilion dv2000t, which the Gateway system then must also share with the graphics. We suspect the M255-E would fare better if it enjoyed the use of 2GB of memory. The iTunes scores for all four laptops were close; the Gateway's latest-generation CPU is offset by its slower clock speed.\nOn MobileMark, the Gateway M255-E enjoyed a 16 percent advantage over the older M250E but, frankly, we expected more. The Fujitsu LifeBook E8210 was 12 percent faster than the M255-E, and it uses an older Core Duo processor also clocked at 1.83GHz (it does, however, use an ATI graphics card with 256MB of video RAM).\nThe Gateway M255-E's 12-cell battery ran for 6 hours, 33 minutes, impressive until you realize that last year's M250E, also equipped with a 12-cell battery, lasted 21 minutes longer. Based on these two Gateway laptops, an admittedly small sample, Core 2 Duo does nothing to improve battery life.\nThe Gateway M255-E includes Windows XP Professional and comes with the pared-down Microsoft Works 8.5 productivity suite, CyberLink's PowerDVD for DVD playback and Power2Go for disc burning."

Sure, the U.S. will probably have to",
        "output": "make some concessions if it\u2019s serious about wanting to freeze Kim\u2019s nuclear and missile programs. Sure, Kim would see it as a propaganda victory, and perhaps as a tactical victory.\nAnd sure, the U.S. would be signing up for more years of threats and bluster aimed at extracting even more concessions. It would have to be practical, clear and consistent \u2014 probably through several presidential administrations \u2014 about what is unacceptable behavior. That\u2019s very hard to do. And it\u2019s by no means risk free.\nBut as long as you keep talking, you\u2019re not shooting.\nIf recent experience shows anything, it\u2019s that declaring it unacceptable for a country like North Korea to have nuclear weapons is mostly bluff, based on the bet that outside pressure can make it too costly to continue. If your opponent is securely in power, doesn\u2019t care about the cost and doesn\u2019t crave international acceptance, he\u2019ll call that bluff. If you choose military action then, unless you\u2019re incredibly lucky, you\u2019re looking at a scenario in which tens of thousands of people \u2014 perhaps millions \u2014 will die, including a lot of Americans.\nDeclaring that Kim must first give up his nuclear program, matching him insult for insult and counting on China to pressure North Korea is encouraging a drift toward conflict. Kim isn\u2019t listening to the Chinese, and he isn\u2019t slowing down. The scenarios for military action only work out if everything goes perfectly. It never does. It would be foolish to expect success in a country as isolated and mysterious as North Korea.\nFormer U.S. officials and foreign policy experts were widely quoted this fall as giving estimates of the chances of war with North Korea ranging from 20 percent to 50 percent. Evan Osnos, the New Yorker writer who visited North Korea for a long story published this fall, finds that a worrisome indicator of groupthink on the U.S. side.\nFurthermore, he argues, the Trump administration\u2019s assumption that Kim would try to use his nuclear arsenal to reunify the Korean peninsula by force may encourage the same \u201cstrike first\u201d mentality that led the United States into Iraq. While no one knows Kim\u2019s intentions, he might well be satisfied with less \u2014 like ensuring his own survival.\nMark Bowden\u2019s piece in the Atlantic, published this summer, remains one of the clearest and most sobering examinations of the options on North Korea.\nBecause of North Korea\u2019s xenophobic isolation and difficult terrain, even a massive pre-emptive strike is unlikely to destroy all of Kim\u2019s nuclear warheads, much less his chemical and biological weapons. He would almost certainly use those he had left.\nHow about a limited strike, aimed at taking out Kim\u2019s nuclear arsenal but leaving him in power? It\u2019s extremely difficult to keep that from turning into all-out war. Kim, not you, decides whether to escalate. He still would have a massive amount of artillery that could hit Seoul, the South Korean capital.\nWhat about a decapitation strike, either a covert operation or an aerial bunker-busting attack aimed at taking out Kim? Both depend on superb intelligence, and there is no reason to believe the U.S. has it. If you miss, and you probably will, all bets are off.\nTalking also means placing a bet: That despite the wild rhetoric, Kim is rational. He doesn\u2019t want to die, and he wants to stay in power. It would cost you something. You might have to offer diplomatic recognition, a path to easing sanctions or a reduction in joint military exercises with South Korea.\nShort of full diplomatic relations, James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence, suggests setting up \u201cinterest sections,\u201d that would provide a conduit for communications, much the way the U.S. dealt with Cuba for decades. Clapper, who once served as a military intelligence officer in South Korea, says it\u2019s not unreasonable to discuss a formal peace treaty with North Korea.\nNegotiations would have to be accompanied by a clear warning that you would fight if Kim dared touch U.S. territory or a U.S. ally. And that if you did fight, Kim would die and his country would be obliterated.\nIgnoring Kim, as President Obama tried to do, didn\u2019t work. Crazy doesn\u2019t work, as President Trump is demonstrating. It\u2019s possible that a combination of talk and pressure won\u2019t, either. On a gut level, it\u2019s less satisfying than making a dramatic move to eliminate the threat.\nBut this is a time for cool heads committed to a long, unglamorous slog. That is to say, diplomacy. How about shutting down his Twitter feed and seeing if Trump can cut a real deal to reduce a real threat? If so, he\u2019d actually have something worth saying about the art of the deal.\nSubmitted by Ilya Gutman on 12/08/2017 - 09:43 pm.\nIt\u2019s amazing how little all those \u201cexperts\u201d are familiar with logic. The first obvious argument against \u201cTalk\u201d approach is that it (including concessions and help) has been tried for over 25 years and didn\u2019t bring any positive results and if didn\u2019t bring any positive results when NK didn\u2019t have nukes, why would it when they have them?\nBut second argument is even more compelling. Let\u2019s start with assumptions: Kim is not crazy, doesn\u2019t want to die, and wants to stay at power \u2013 so far we are all on the same page. But then the \u201ctalking\u201d proponents are saying that we need to give him something but include a warning that if Kim does something stupid (like attacking South Korea, for example, I guess), he \u201cwould die and his country would be obliterated.\u201d So, logically, if he would be truly frightened by this threat and would not dare do anything stupid, why don\u2019t we cut to the chase and give him this ultimatum right away: You either die and your country is obliterated (I guess the first one would be infinitely more important to him than the second, though) or you give up your nukes and after that we will let you live and stay at power (in which case China will be a guarantor). Because if he doesn\u2019t care or won\u2019t believe us now, how can one logically assume that he would later? And in this case the entire approach of more talks seems totally irrational and unreasonable.\nSubmitted by Dennis Litfin on 12/09/2017 - 03:02 pm.\nwant Trump in serious result talk with anyone. He carries no credibility in this Country or in other Countries\u2026.other than maybe now Israel, and that could go South anytime with Trump\u2019s finicky, narcissistic persona. All we can do is hope that the Generals and adults within the power element that surrounds Trump will be able to convince and override him when and if that crucial time occurs.\nSubmitted by Carrie Preston on 12/09/2017 - 04:18 pm.\nDo we know in what stage of defense NK is in? Are the nukes ready to go or do they need to be moved and assembled? ( A nightmare in itself. Who is doing the moving and are they capable of moving them w/o mishaps or accidents during a crisis).\nIs there still a chance that Kim\u2019s regime can be toppled? By assassination. Maybe someone connected with his inner circle?\nAbove all, President Trump should stop tweeting. About NK and a lot of other things. Not just because he rattles Kim\u2019s cage but it makes Trumpf look weak and unstable on the world stage."

Doing so brought his total commutations to 1,385, the most of any president in history, edging out",
        "output": "Woodrow Wilson's 1,366.\nBut the big headline \u2014 record-breaking clemency \u2014 misses the nuance. Obama's record on clemency is different than his immediate predecessors, and it's also very much the same.\nThe president has the power to commute a federal prisoner's sentence or offer a full pardon. A commutation shortens sentences but does not restore civil liberties such as the right to own a gun or vote. A full pardon can restore voting rights but does not wipe away a criminal record. Obama only took the record on commutations \u2014 in other areas, he's still very much behind.\nP.S. Ruckman, a political scientist and editor of the blog PardonPower, has spent years tracking the use of presidential clemency and says presidents should use the power regularly and often.\n\"Of course we have to give [Obama] credit for doing something,\" Ruckman says. \"No one should be dismissing what he\u2019s done. But the bigger picture is it highlights the need for regular, systematic exercise of clemency, throughout the term. For most presidents throughout history, they granted pardons throughout the term. That lasted until Eisenhower. With Eisenhower, he waited two or three months and post Eisenhower, presidents would wait even longer.\"\nAccording to Ruckman's research, Obama's first term was least merciful full term since George Washington's second. Obama pardoned 22 people and commuted 1 sentence; Washington pardoned 30 people in his second term.\n\"It\u2019s parts of checks and balances,\" Ruckman says. \"The president, when he doesn\u2019t pardon, he\u2019s deferring and saying Congress is perfect and the courts are perfect. As long as sentences are regular and serving of sentences is going on and people are rehabilitating \u2014 and I think that stuff is going on every day of the week \u2014 there should be pardons, clemency.\"\nIn April 2014, the Obama administration announced a clemency initiative and asked for applications from low-level, nonviolent offenders who had served at least 10 years in prison and had no history of violent behavior before their conviction.\nThousands of applications poured in (even before the call, Obama was receiving record numbers of petitions), making Obama the most-petitioned president in history by a wide margin.\nBut the clemency project didn't begin until six years into Obama's presidency. His first commutation came on Nov. 21, 2011, and the next batch, only eight people, came Dec. 19, 2013. Most commutations came in the final year of his presidency: 86.7 percent of all his commutations occurred in 2016 and 2017.\nAlong with Obama's record-breaking number of commutations, Obama has issued a record number of denials, as well. His acceptance rate for pardons or commutations is 4.4 percent, which roughly matches the trend of modern presidents but is still far lower than most 20th-century presidents. Before Ronald Reagan, presidents approved between 20 and 30 percent of the petitions they received.\nFDR surpasses all presidents since 1900 for clemency, though he also served the longest. Woodrow Wilson, ranked No. 2, is now second to Obama in commutations, but he granted commutations steadily throughout his presidency, instead of toward the end.\n\"It is true mathematically that most presidents have granted the largest number of pardons in the fourth and final year of their term,\" Ruckman says. \"What\u2019s not true is that presidents have bulked this up with outrageous splurges at the end.\"\nRuckman says he's thrilled with Obama's use of the pardon, but wishes that Obama had granted clemency steadily throughout his terms.\n\"I worry that while he\u2019s doing short-term good, he\u2019s doing long-term damage to the pardon power,\" he says."

The Jets are gathered in a tense circle at night against a similar playground backdrop, snapping their fingers in unison.\nMonge comments that audiences might presume gang members were moving with intimidating finger snapping to keep beat with a jazz rhythm, but actually the scene was inspired by a stranger that Robbins observed showing nervous energy at a bus stop. Robbins translated his impression into an edgy, explosive cool for the \u201cWest Side Story\u201d scene.\nThe book \u201cSomething Coming, Something Good: West Side Story and the American Imagination\u201d by Misha Berson provides an insider\u2019s look into the making of the 1957 Broadway production. In the book, published in 2011, Berson reveals how the show was nearly called \u201cEast Side Story\u201d with Jews and Catholics as rival gangs. She also explains how the creators struggled with signing on investors because of the musical\u2019s not-so-happy ending, which broke from tradition of the most successful Broadway shows.\nThe Atlanta Symphony Orchestra presents a tribute to Leonard Bernstein in January 2019.

Through 10 playoff games, the Coquitlam, BC native has posted 17 points (5G, 12A) with five multi-point games.\nOn Tuesday, Barzal had the secondary assist on the eventual game-winner for Seattle to take a 2-1 series lead over the Kelowna Rockets and followed that up with another helper in Wednesday's 4-2 loss, evening the series at two games apiece.\nThe series shifted back to Seattle on Friday where Barzal exploded for three assists in the T-Birds' 5-3 win, helping him earn First Star honors. The 20-year-old forward followed up his three-point night with another multi-point game (1G, 1A) to help Seattle advance to the WHL Final and end the Rockets' season for the second straight year.\nThe Thunderbirds will face off against the Regina Pats for the for the Ed Chynoweth Cup - the WHL championship. The Pats' 112 regular-season points will give them home-ice advance for the series. The T-Birds and Pats played just once this season, back on Oct. 30 in Regina, where Seattle lost 6-3. This will be Barzal's first meeting with the Pats as he was still with the Islanders during the late October meeting.\nThe winner of the Seattle-Regina series will take home the WHL title and advance to the 2017 Memorial Cup, a four-team tournament represented by the champions of the three leagues that make up the CHL (WHL, Ontario Hockey League & Quebec Major Junior Hockey League) as well as a host team. The Windsor Spitfires are hosting this year's Memorial Cup.\nThe 2017 World Championships start this week (May 5) in Germany and France. Current Islanders Anders Lee (USA), Brock Nelson (USA), Calvin de Haan (CAN), Thomas Greiss (GER) & Dennis Seidenberg (GER) have already been named to their national teams but stay tuned to @NYIslanders on Twitter to see if any New York Islanders prospects are named to represent their respective countries."

        "output": "he also used the trip--the first of what is expected to be many in the name of education reform--to highlight an example of a \"new American school.\"\n\"You may not believe this,\" Mr. Bush told students in each of the three classrooms he visited, \"but I learn from talking with you.\"\nBut he also acknowledged the political and public-relations purposes of his visit.\n\"Good examples will inspire others,\" Mr. Bush said. \"I would like people across the country to see this and learn from it.\"\n\"You're on the cutting edge,\" he continued. \"You're revolutionizing4education, and we have to do this across the country.\"\nThe President, accompanied on his trip by Secretary of Education Lamar Alexander, even made a direct reference to his desire to send a message via the news media.\n\"These guys,\" he said, gesturing toward reporters gathered in the back of the classroom, \"they won't say it, but they'll be impressed by what they see here, and that will help other schools.\"\nLater last Wednesday, in a speech delivered in front of the downtown branch of the St. Paul Public Library, Mr. Bush said he came to Minnesota because the state--which theoretically allows students to attend any of its public schools--is \"a pioneer, leading the nation in educational choice,\" and the Saturn School is \"exploring new frontiers in American education.\"\n\"Like any new idea, we don't know what tomorrow holds for the Saturn School,\" Mr. Bush said. \"And there may be aspects of its approach that generate controversy.\"\n\"But when we say 'break the mold,\"' he added, \"we've got to give communities the power to experiment, think anew, be daring.\"\n\"I like what works. I'm confident about the prospect of new American schools in communities across this country,\" he said. \"With more accountability and choice in our schools, with a national commitment to lifelong learning, with the active engagement of our business community in the business of education, we will embark on a new voyage in the American experience.\"\nThe plant, where workers and managers have collaborated to redesign the workplace, is often cited as a model by Mr. Alexander as well.\nThe Saturn School, which is located in downtown St. Paul, serves students who would be in grades 4 through 7 in a more traditional school. They are chosen by lottery and are a heterogenous group. Some of their teachers receive substantially higher pay than others in the district--a fact that has generated some controversy in the community.\nThe school employs a variety of unusual instructional techniques and organizational principles.\nThe school uses individualized programs for each student, is orgael10lnized into classes that include students at multiple grade levels, de-emphasizes grades, uses cooperative-learning techniques, assigns independent student projects, has a longer-than-standard school year, and makes extensive use of educational technology.\nThe first classroom Mr. Bush visited, for example, contained computers recessed into desks with clear tops and lap-level keyboards that pull out like a drawer. The students were studying different topics at different levels on a system their teacher said automatically increases the difficulty of the work as a student progresses.\nIn another classroom, Mr. Bush was introduced to a computer system called Discourse, which consists of small computers for each student and a central terminal for their teacher.\nBecause the central computer is linked with the students' computers and a television set above the teacher's desk, the teacher can \"broadcast\" a question on the TV screen and have the students transmit answers, which can also be selectively displayed on the screen.\nJane Barton, the class's teacher, said the system is used most often to conduct surveys of student knowledge, attitudes, and instructional preferences. Students said they also use the system for instructional purposes, such as writing exercises and math drills.\nMr. Bush used it to ask students whether they think they will go to college and where, and whether they prefer math or English.\nBrandon Seeger, 11, who occupied the teacher's chair during the demonstration, typed for the President: \"Will you go to collage someday, and if so witch one.\"\nMr. Bush then learned a lesson about the unpredictability of computers when an answer he typed in response to a student's question stubbornly refused to appear on the television screen.\nHe fielded several questions orally, ranging from whether the Secret Service follows him to the bowling alley to why he wanted to be President.\nHe talked about \"doing good things for the country,\" and \"contributing to world peace,\" adding, \"It's a big-picture thing.\"\nIn the final classroom Mr. Bush visited, two students demonstrated miniature robotic devices they had designed, including cranes and vehicles. The motile projects, which look like Lego toys, are controlled by computer.\n\"Frankly, I was a bit surprised by the place,\" the President said after his tour. \"Such high tech and such young kids.\"\nAsked by a reporter how schools in poor communities would pay for such innovations, he said they should redirect their existing resources by eliminating unnecessary bureaucracy."

        "output": "will run from March 10 through March 13 across the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC. For those of you in the U.S., the PlayStation 4 and UPlay crowd can jump on board starting 1 p.m. EST tomorrow, March 10. The free play weekend will end Monday at the same time. On Xbox One, your start and stop time will be 4 a.m. EST.\nAs Ubisoft recently did with Watch Dogs 2, this isn't just a demo of Steep featuring a limit on the game's features. You won't, for instance, be able to only pick the snowboard and slide down one section of the mountain. As Gamespot is reporting, this is another full-blown offering, letting players download the entire game and play it to their heart's content for the next four days. You'll have access to the full mountain, all of the game's different modes, all of the modes of travel; everything. Even better is the fact that you'll also have access to the Alaska portion of the game, which was recently added via a free update.\nYou can think of Steep as a sort of MMO for snow sports. The game's massive landscapes are totally open, and you'll come across other players on the fly. You can quickly group up with them to tackle challenges together, or just ignore them. There are plenty of objectives to complete along the way, as well as the ability to create and accept challenges crafted by other players.\nIn Steep, the player has access to four modes of travel including skis, snowboard, wingsuit and paragliding. Once you're on the mountain, you can simply pick which activity you want to do and dive straight in. If you want to tackle objectives, go for it. If you just want to tool around while some relaxing music plays in the background, you can do that, too. If you want to seek out areas where the damn mountain will talk to you while you lazily ski down the slopes, that's also an option.\nIf you're picking up what Steep is putting down, you'll be able to purchase the game for 50 percent off throughout the weekend. If you want to upgrade to the Gold Edition, that'll be available for 40 percent off for a limited time on consoles, too. Both versions of the game will be 50 percent off on the Ubisoft Store.\nOf course, since you'll be playing the full game, purchasing it will let you roll over all of your progress into the final build, so nothing you do this weekend will be lost."

Henrique Capriles campaigned for president of Venezuela last April, he couldn&apos;t venture more than a few steps without being hounded by dozens of sharp-elbowed cameramen and photographers. Nearly eight months later, the visibly thinner and exhausted opposition leader is accompanied by just a handful of",
        "output": "journalists at what was supposed to be one of the final, electrifying opposition rallies ahead of this weekend&apos;s mayoral elections.\nCritics say the shrinking media coverage has been deliberate. Even while Venezuelans endure their toughest economic crisis in 15 years of socialist rule, the opposition has been largely knocked from public view by what they claim is a government-led campaign to intimidate media outlets that give airtime to the opposition and the nation&apos;s mounting woes.\nBetween January and September, the number of attacks on journalists, cases of harassment and reports of censorship has risen 56 percent compared with the first nine months of 2012, according to a complaint filed by press freedom groups in October to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.\nEven more damaging has been the sale of several media outlets once critical of the government to owners who more closely follow the official line.\nCapriles calls it an \"information blockade,\" and warns that President Nicolas Maduro&apos;s alleged attempts to silence the opposition signal a more authoritarian style of rule to come unless resoundingly reject his policies at the ballot box this Sunday. The election for mayors and city councils is a dogfight in this deeply polarized country. It is also Maduro&apos;s first electoral test since he defeated Capriles in April by a razor-thin margin following Hugo Chavez&apos;s death from cancer.\n\"Without a doubt this is one of the toughest moments in our history to get our message out,\" said Capriles, who has been crisscrossing the country stumping for opposition candidates.\nYet for all the opposition complaints, analysts say the government&apos;s biggest trump card going into the vote isn&apos;t its grip on the media but rather Maduro&apos;s political instincts. Facing a steady decline in the polls, Maduro on Nov. 9 seized control of several retail outlets, arrested dozens of store managers and slashed prices on plasma TVs and fridges to strike a blow against opponents he accuses of waging an \"economic war\" against his government. The measures have led to a steady improvement in the president&apos;s approval rating, said Luis Vicente Leon of Caracas-based pollster Datanalisis.\nThe most likely result from Sunday&apos;s vote, Leon said, is the opposition winning in Caracas and other big cities while the government remains dominant in the countryside, giving each side a claim on victory.\n\"There&apos;s an economic crisis in Venezuela but paradoxically who has best capitalized on it politically is the government that generated it,\" said Leon. \"They&apos;ve combined rhetoric with action and, just as importantly, has managed to sell a narrative of who are the ones to blame for the economic troubles.\"\nThe government denies it is threatening journalists or forcing its viewpoint, and attributes the decline in coverage of Capriles to the fact that voters and media bosses alike were turned off by his unsubstantiated claims of fraud following his defeat in the presidential race.\n\"There&apos;s no campaign to make him invisible,\" said Igor Molina, a high-ranking official at telecommunications regulator Conatel. \"Perhaps it is just that the overexposure which he was accustomed to is gone.\"\nThe most emblematic example of Venezuela&apos;s rougher media landscape is the takeover of TV station Globovision. When Chavez refused to renew the license of independent broadcaster RCTV in 2007, Globovision remained as the lone voice broadcasting criticism of the government. But after being fined $2 million last year for its coverage of the security forces&apos; violent quelling of a prison riot, the channel was sold in May to three local businessmen with no prior media experience. Many veteran journalists were immediately fired or quit, and the channel overnight stopped broadcasting opposition news conferences and rallies.\n\"This is a sophisticated strategy because you&apos;re not closing down the company,\" said Carlos Correa, of Espacio Publico, the nongovernmental organization behind the complaint with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. \"You&apos;re simply asking someone you&apos;re close to, or have business dealings with, to do a favor and buy a media company to neutralize its coverage.\"\nGlobovision&apos;s owners haven&apos;t commented on their plans for the channel or the transaction. But last month the saga seemed to repeat itself when the editor of the country&apos;s main business newspaper, El Mundo, was fired after publishing an article on the hemorrhaging of the central bank&apos;s foreign currency reserves. Just a few weeks earlier, El Mundo&apos;s owner Cadena Capriles, the country&apos;s largest print media conglomerate, was purchased by a group of UK and Curacao-based investors. Cadena Capriles&apos; founding owners aren&apos;t directly related to the politician who shares their last name.\nIn another episode with a chilling effect on coverage, Maduro in October publicly criticized newspaper Diario 2001 as \"bandits\" and called for it to be \"punished\" for publishing an article about gasoline shortages in Latin America&apos;s largest oil exporter. Within days of the tongue-lashing, federal prosecutors opened an investigation.\nThe government is also targeting the opposition on the Internet, until now a largely untouched forum for government criticism. Last month it blocked access to dozens of websites used to track the black market value of the nation&apos;s currency, which has plunged to 10 times its official 6.3-per-dollar value.\nWhile coverage of the opposition is being curtailed, Maduro is making greater use of the airwaves. Data compiled by Andres Canizalez, a media researcher at Catholic University in Caracas, show the president has appeared on television an average of two hours a day, surpassing a mark left by his loquacious mentor Chavez, thanks to a law requiring radio and TV channels to interrupt normal programming to broadcast the president&apos;s activities.\nIt&apos;s not clear if the government tactics are actually persuading voters. While Capriles may be less visible, Venezuela&apos;s economic problems are readily apparent in most supermarkets, where staples such as milk and toilet paper are harder to find and prices for other goods have skyrocketed in line with an official 54 percent inflation rate. The opposition is hopeful that such hardships will allow it to build on the 56 municipalities that it and dissident factions of Chavismo won in the last local elections in 2008.\nAP Writer Joshua Goodman contributed to this report."

President Trump wants Congress to limit the number of family members who immigrants here legally can sponsor to join them in the United States. As NPR's John Burnett reports, the proposal has caused panic in some communities.\nJOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: After Donald Trump won the presidency, frightened immigrants rushed to legal offices to get green cards, become naturalized citizens and apply for protection under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. That's the program for immigrants brought here as children. Now there's a new scramble.\nKATIE MULLINS: They are calling. And to be frank, they are freaked out.\nBURNETT: Katie Mullins is an immigration attorney in San Antonio. She works for an advocacy group called RAICES.\nMULLINS: People are in a rush to try to get applications submitted as soon as possible just in case the law does change. They're very nervous that their 22-year-old daughter who lives in their country of origin is going to be completely denied the opportunity that she would otherwise have to come here on a family-based petition.\nBURNETT: The president's immigration blueprint would dramatically reduce the number of green cards issued to immigrants for permanent residency in the United States. The proposal would make parents, siblings and adult children of U.S. sponsors ineligible. The Senate deadlocked over this and other divisive issues and could not agree on an immigration makeover, at least for now. President Trump in his State of the Union got booed by Democrats for misrepresenting how it works now.\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives.\nTRUMP: Under our plan, we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children.\nBURNETT: That got Nancy Burrion's attention. She's a customer service representative who lives in Houston. Her parents brought her here from Central America, and she became a naturalized citizen. That allows her to petition to legalize her Salvadoran mother, Brigida, who lives in California. Brigida and 200,000 other Salvadorans must leave the country in the next 19 months. They had been allowed to live and work in the U.S. since a pair of earthquakes struck El Salvador in 2001, but the Trump administration recently terminated their temporary protected status.\nNANCY BURRION: I want to make sure that she doesn't go anywhere, that she is going to stay here with us, which is her family.\nBURNETT: Nancy Burrion and her siblings anticipate paying up to $10,000 to an attorney to shepherd their mom's case through the Byzantine sponsorship process.\nBURRION: We feel it was the best route to go before they do change any laws.\nBURNETT: The American Immigration Lawyers Association says its members across the country are experiencing a surge of consultations. Maurice Goldman works in a small family firm in Tucson. He says he's working weekends and missing his son's tennis tournaments just to keep up with new clients. He says many are in for a long wait.\nMAURICE GOLDMAN: For example, if you're from the United States and you want to sponsor your sister from Mexico, right now the processing time is looking like at least 20 years, if not longer.\nBURNETT: Because of congressionally imposed caps on immigrants from individual countries and on categories of family members, the wait for an immigrant visa can be decades for some countries like Mexico, India and the Philippines. Now add to those waiting times the crush of new applicants.\nGOLDMAN: And so you're going to see people potentially waiting an additional five years or longer.\nBURNETT: The president has assured even if a new law sets limits on family-sponsored immigration, no one will be kicked out of line.

She also noted that the violation of children\u2019s rights appears as a systemic failure, SITA reported.\nDubovcov\u00e1 had already warned about malnourished children in reform centres in May, based on a survey conducted in these facilities suggesting that breakfast for children aged 6-11 costs \u20ac0.33, while a whole-day meal costs \u20ac2.28 per day. Food for 18 year olds costs \u20ac2.69 per day. To demonstrate that the state financing of food for children in these facilities is insufficient, Dubovcov\u00e1 brought a sample of the daily menu to MPs on the parliamentary committee for education.\nShe also noted that these centres use dubious methods, such as gynaecological checkups of girls each time they leave the institution or shaving children\u2019s head regardless of their age as a hygienic precaution, SITA reported.\nRoma children made up the majority in most schools for children with special needs that she visited, Dubovcov\u00e1 noted in her report, adding that most of these children face language barriers and did not attend pre-school.\nParliament has requested the government to address the issue of the headquarters of Dubovcov\u00e1\u2019s office, which is now in rented premises, not a state-owned building.\nThe US Embassy in Bratislava however has noticed Dubovcov\u00e1\u2019s efforts and presented her with the Human Rights Defender Award on April 2 in recognition for \u201cher efforts to defend and promote the rights of all Slovak citizens, and to ensure those rights are recognised and upheld by all relevant institutions throughout Slovakia\u201d, according to an April memo sent to The Slovak Spectator.\nInstead of seriously dealing with Dubovcov\u00e1\u2019s reports, state officials have shown a habit of accusing her of violating the law and mixing politics with her human rights agenda. At a specially summoned session of parliament on January 30, which featured what some have termed hate speech by a high-level Smer official, deputies of the ruling party rejected a resolution drafted by the opposition condemning the government\u2019s treatment of Dubovcov\u00e1.\nWhen speaking to the press on June 10, Dubovcov\u00e1 noted that her recommendations pertaining to last year\u2019s controversial police raid in Moldava nad Bodvou have not been carried out, the TASR newswire reported."

        "input": "Budget writers at the state Capitol caught a bit of luck last week: They learned they would have about $860 million in extra revenue to work with as they craft the state\u2019s next two-year budget.\nYet Democratic leaders in Washington\u2019s House say that\u2019s still not enough money to cover all of",
        "output": "the state\u2019s priorities, which include investing more in mental health services, higher education, early learning programs and K-12 schools.\nOn Monday, House Democrats released a new two-year budget plan that would include about $1.4 billion in additional taxes to help pay for some of their desired programs.\nThe House\u2019s $52.6-billion proposal represents about an $8 billion increase over what the Legislature is spending in its current two-year budget. Leaders in the Senate, which is also controlled by Democrats, are expected to release a different spending plan in the coming days.\nThe House proposal would rely on a mixture of new taxes, including a tax on \u201cextraordinary profits,\u201d to pay for about $2.3 billion in new policy investments.\nThat $2.3 billion comes on top of a roughly $5.8 billion spending increase House Democrats say is needed to maintain existing programs.\nHouse leaders said much of the new money that has filled state coffers in the past two years \u2014 about $4 billion \u2014 is needed to finish phasing in K-12 education investments the Legislature already approved in 2017. Those investments were part of the Legislature's answer to a 2012 state Supreme Court ruling known as McCleary, which found that the state was failing to provide enough money for K-12 schools. The case came to an end last year, when the high court ruled the Legislature had met its constitutional obligations.\nBut lawmakers across the political spectrum have agreed the McCleary deal fell short when it came to adequately paying for some K-12 needs, including special education. The plan the House released Monday would invest about $70 million more in special education over the next two years.\nWhile minority Republicans have argued no new taxes should be needed to pay for those programs and others, House Majority Leader Pat Sullivan, D-Covington, forcefully rejected that premise Monday.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be fooled when they say that we have $4.5 billion to spend on new things, because it is absolutely not true,\u201d Sullivan told reporters.\nThe cornerstone of the House Democrats\u2019 tax package is a 9.9 percent tax on the sale of high-valued assets, such as stocks and bonds, which House leaders are calling a tax on \u201cextraordinary profits.\u201d It is similar to past Democratic proposals to tax capital gains, but would apply only to profits above $100,000, or above $200,000 for married couples, a higher threshold than the capital-gains tax Gov. Jay Inslee proposed in his budget package last December.\nWith Democrats in control, will Inslee finally get his capital gains tax?\nIt's not the largest addition to the governor's proposed revenue plan, but it's likely to cause the most fuss.\nThat tax proposal would raise about $780 million in the current 2019-21 budget cycle and $1.9 billion in the upcoming 2021-23 budget cycle.\nHouse Rep. Gael Tarleton, D-Seattle, said about 13,400 people would be subject to the tax, which she said equates to about 0.4 percent of the state's taxpayers. Retirement accounts would be exempt from the tax, as would sales of single-family homes, farms and livestock.\nTarleton, who chairs the House Finance Committee, said the House budget plan would help correct problems that have led Washington to \"have the most upside-down, antiquated tax code in the country.\"\n\"Wealth continues to concentrate in the hands of fewer and fewer individuals, who pay less and less into critical public investments as a proportion of their accumulated wealth,\" Tarleton said.\nAnother part of the House Democratic plan would charge higher taxes on owners of high-value real estate when they sell their property. The proposal would increase the real-estate excise tax on properties above $1.5 million, while lowering the tax rate for properties selling for $500,000 or less. That plan will raise about $130 million through 2021.\nMeanwhile, an increase in business and occupation taxes on some businesses \u2014 including Amazon and Microsoft \u2014 would help pay for about $427 million in college and workforce education programs in the next two years, House leaders said.\nWhile Microsoft president Brad Smith has already signaled his support for such a plan, an Amazon representative declined to comment.\nThe House Democratic budget also relies on about $68 million in revenue from closing certain tax exemptions.\nOther key spending elements in the House plan include about $426 million for school employee health benefits, along with more than $150 million for behavioral health programs, including increasing staffing at the troubled Western State Hospital in Lakewood. It would pay for already-negotiated raises for state employees, while adding nearly 1,500 preschool slots for low-income families.\nRepublicans are likely to vehemently oppose the proposal due to its tax components. State Rep. Drew Stokesbary, R-Auburn, said the billions in additional state revenues that have accrued since 2017 are \u201cmore than sufficient to cover our priorities\u201d without new taxes.\nFurthermore, Stokesbary said he is unsure any attempt to tax profits from selling stocks would survive a legal challenge. Should the Legislature pass either the House Democrats\u2019 proposal or a similar capital-gains tax, the legislation would likely be challenged in court as an unconstitutional income tax, he said Monday.\nHe questioned the wisdom of House Democrats proposing a tax that might get struck down in court.\n\"That's even more unsustainable than using other taxes,\" said Stokesbary, the ranking Republican on the House Appropriations Committee.\nNor is it clear whether the House plan would have enough votes to pass the state Senate. In the past, a handful of moderate Senate Democrats have expressed reticence about capital gains tax proposals that targeted sales of stocks and bonds.\nUltimately, the final budget will have to be negotiated between the two chambers. The final product will likely differ significantly from the proposal House leaders unveiled Monday.\nThe Senate is expected to release its budget plan Friday. The current state legislative session is scheduled to end April 28."

Since it's usually a lengthy process, good job searching habits are key to staying in the game and landing the position you want. If you just spam resumes without a game plan in mind, you'll",
        "output": "be giving yourself a huge handicap. The SFGate came up with the top five job search habits which we've collected for you below. While the points are broad, sticking to them will help you stay focused and on-track.\n1. Persistence \u2013 Whether you've adopted a fire and forget attitude or have given up entirely, forgetting to be persistent can shut more doors than you might realize. Never assume that your applications and emails have been received, read, or processed. Companies and hiring managers tend to be overwhelmed with emails, and it's very easy to let one slip through the cracks \u2013 you might be that one. Rather than spamming companies, wait roughly one to two weeks before reaching out to a company or individual to confirm that they received your information. If you don't hear back after the second or third email, then you can forget about it.\nIn a general sense, don't ever give up the search. The day you wake up and decide to drop the whole thing is the day you've truly lost out. Just make sure you always evaluate your approach so you're not beating your head against a wall with strategies that don't work.\n2. Follow Up \u2013 In lockstep with persistence, always follow up. Whether it's a call, text, or email, it's better to follow up on an initial outreach. Don't take silence as rejection: there are litanies of reasons why an individual or organization hasn't reached out to you. Following up, whether after a job application or an interview, puts you back in the minds of whoever you've contacted. Even if it leads to a confirmed rejection, it's better to know than to let your imagination run wild.\n3. Resilience \u2013 Searching for jobs usually comes with a huge dose of rejection. If you have difficulty coping with it, you'll be worse for wear in the long run. There are many ways to handle it, so the important thing is to pick whatever works for you. Even at the best of times, searching for a job is a strenuous grind that can wear you down and a string of rejections will damage anyone's ego. Think about a job search as a marathon: you're in it for the long game, not a quick win.\n4. Stay Connected \u2013 While it's possible to find a job with a cold application, it's generally a lot easier to find a position through your network. The people in your network can point you towards job openings in their company or to people they know who have them. Either way, staying connected broadens and reinforces your support system and the chances that you'll find an opening. Plus, once you find a position, companies tend to hire people who are recommended by people who know them. It's a lot easier to trust someone they can be vouched for.\n5. Give Back \u2013 You've probably benefited from a helping hand during your career, so don't forget the people you know who could use one too. Whether you're in a low point during your job search or just landed your dream position, keep in mind the people you know who could use some help. This is a great way to tend and expand your network while strengthening ties with other professionals. You never know, advising someone on their resume might lead to a big payoff later in your career. Plus it's always a good idea to help those in need!"

        "input": "Parents and educators at a struggling, racially isolated San Francisco school hope their changing community means better times ahead.\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In recent years, students at Malcolm X Academy in the city's Bayview section have been coming up with design ideas for a paved pathway that will eventually link their",
        "output": "public elementary school to a housing complex that's under construction nearby. The complex is slated to replace a once-crumbling public-housing development that was torn down in 2010.\nSome students have asked for benches in the shape of fruits and vegetables; others have requested raised planting beds. All voted for a mural paying homage to national heroes such as Rosa Parks and Sonia Sotomayor. Developers who are building the pathway have promised to include some of their ideas in the structure.\nBut having that promise fulfilled isn't the main objective for child advocates at the nearby Center for Cities and Schools, an urban-planning think tank that has spearheaded the conversation about the pathway in collaboration with a local chapter of the National Organization of Minority Architects. \"The pathway is a symbol of a larger goal,\" said Shirl Buss, the center's creative director who oversees its elementary-school workshops, helping students connect with the neighborhoods in which they live. \"It represents a pathway into the new community.\"\nHoused at the University of California at Berkeley, the Center for Cities and Schools spends a lot of its time pressuring local officials to address struggling public schools in their housing-redevelopment projects. And that is exactly what the center is trying to do now with Malcolm X \u2014 a small, underenrolled elementary school in which close to 95 percent of the students come from low-income families and more than 4 in 5 children are African-American, Hispanic, or Pacific Islander. In 2013, the last year California ranked its schools, Malcolm X performed in the lowest 10 percent of all the state's schools. If the organization's work is successful, advocates say, the K-5 school could become a model for a cooperative approach between cities and school districts seeking to overhaul troubled communities.\nIf the approach doesn't work, Malcolm X could join a long list of schools that were left to flounder when gentrification came knocking.\nFinding ways to integrate the nation's most segregated neighborhoods and desegregate its public schools tend to be separate endeavors.\nFinding ways to integrate the nation's most segregated neighborhoods and desegregate its public schools tend to be separate endeavors. The work is generally undertaken by different city agencies, culling from different budgets. And the officials doing the work rarely sit down together to debrief each other on their projects. \"School-district planners are not often in communication with developers,\" said Heather Schwartz, a policy researcher who specializes in education policy at the RAND Corporation.\nBut in recent years, as racial and economic isolation continues to plague American cities, a small group of planners in Maryland's Montgomery County, Atlanta, St. Louis, and here in San Francisco are working to promote a more cooperative approach. Their motivation stems, in part, from a 2012 report showing that more than 15 percent of the nation's African-American students still attended \"apartheid schools,\" a term coined by Gary Orfield, the codirector of the Civil Rights project at UCLA, to describe schools in which at least 99 percent of the students are black. The news has given planners a renewed sense of urgency about using neighborhood-integration efforts to bring about school integration. But it's not clear whether that urgency will translate into progress.\nDespite its otherwise-picturesque location overlooking San Francisco Bay, drugs and poverty have long plagued the historically black Bayview neighborhood. Many of the residents live in shabbily built public-housing developments, and the crime rate is notoriously high. Because of this, in 2005, officials decided to include the neighborhood in an ambitious redevelopment program.\nBroad in scope and utopian in vision, the $2 billion project, known as Hope SF, seeks to desegregate five of San Francisco's poorest pockets by tearing down federal housing projects and building mixed-income units in their place, which officials hope will bring greater racial and economic balance to the neighborhoods. The plan was undertaken in collaboration with affordable-housing developers and has been celebrated by city and state leaders, along with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and the Senator Dianne Feinstein. And while detractors complain that these types of programs sometimes push a community's original residents out during the construction phase, supporters say it is a way to make good on federal housing goals as laid out in the Fair Housing Act of 1968, which urged communities to do away with segregated public housing. But the program has worried educators and child advocates who want to make sure schools like Malcolm X aren't left out of the integration process.\nThe Center for Cities and Schools has worked with an array of stakeholders in an effort to make it a better place for current students and an attractive one for newcomers, many of them middle-class and white, who began moving into the nearby apartments in 2013 when the first phase of construction was completed. The final Hope SF project will contain a housing complex with up to 800 units, including 250 public-housing units, some market-rate homes for sale, and some affordable rentals. It already includes attractive walkways, courtyards, a concrete-floored community center, and lots of lighting for evening. Developers say the project will eventually include a store, a day-care center, and several play areas for children.\nCarol Galante, a longtime affordable-housing advocate who served as the Federal Housing Administration commissioner in the Obama administration until this year, says the idea behind these types of redevelopment projects is to do something \"holistic.\" \"It's an opportunity to bring people into the neighborhood and make it better for the people who already live there,\" said Galante, now a faculty member at UC Berkeley.\nSchool board member Shamann Walton says these projects are also an opportunity to invest in campuses that are often neglected. \"We want to make sure our schools grow and get better with these new developments,\" he said, noting that the city is working to integrate schools in other redeveloping communities as well.\nAs part of that broader effort, the district has introduced Mandarin-immersion programs and strong science departments, features that are popular with middle-class families, at schools in and around the transforming Bayview neighborhood. One such school is the STEM-focused Willie L. Brown Jr. Middle School, which opens this fall. School officials have tried to encourage middle-class parents to enroll their children at Willie L. Brown by guaranteeing them a slot \u2014 a sort of \"golden ticket\" \u2014 into their high school of choice if they attend the school. It's a big sell in a school district with a highly competitive high-school entrance process.\nMalcolm X, for its part, got a boost a few years ago when the district placed it on a list of schools in need of intensive support. That allowed the district to pump money and resources in, adding a full-time literacy coach and a facilitator to keep track of how students are doing and what strategies are working to keep them on target. In turn, the school hired a new principal and got grant money to purchase new iPads for each classroom. It retooled its reading program to be more appealing to both reluctant and voracious readers and to better serve students at all reading levels. The new system includes book bins inside each classroom, allowing students to choose what they want to read, rather than an all-class system in which everyone reads the same book.\nSchool officials also tried to create a sense of community by instituting features common in upper-middle-class schools \u2014 such as nights for games, science activities, and movies \u2014 and added a robotics program and a school garden. It even added an outdoor classroom designed by fourth- and fifth-graders, who spent months determining its d\u00e9cor, building planting beds, walkways, and walls, with the help of the National Organization of Minority Architects and the Center for Cities and Schools.\nOn a recent morning this past spring, 10 fourth-graders were musing over the ideas they had come up with for a playhouse that will accompany the outdoor classroom; some wanted the playhouse to be decorated with large geometric shapes, while others thought it should include thick, painted plywood flowers. There was talk of a superhero theme, and a discussion of flooring options. Buss, with the Center for Cities and Schools, stood by a cardboard panel that incorporated all of the student's ideas. As they waited to vote, they were given one last chance to promote their proposals. \"Do you want to talk about your idea?\" Buss asked a boy sitting at a table near the front of the room. \"You're lobbying for it. Talk it up.\" The boy mumbled something nearly inaudible, after which Buss went on to the next student, who wanted to incorporate several themes into one playhouse, a collaborative idea that had been bantered about earlier in the day. \"If we do that, we can have a floor,\" the girl, Genesis Martinez, said. \"And we can put the flowers on the floor.\"\nNearby, in a fifth-grade classroom, teacher Laura Walker was showing her students a documentary about their historic neighborhood. It was developed in the 1940s during the Great Migration, when African-American men flocked to the area with their families to work in the now-defunct naval shipyard. Walker said the film was part of a social-studies unit on migration and exploration, which would include lessons on the Vikings, Christopher Columbus, and the American explorers Lewis and Clark.\nFamilies whose children attend the school say they have noticed a difference. Lisa Afalava, a mother with a fifth-grader, says Malcolm X offers impressive after-school programs, including Mandarin classes. The school, she says, has worked to improve attendance by offering students awards for coming to school on time, and has created a warm learning environment. \"The staff is really passionate about the kids,\" she said. Others, like Brenda Rios, whose son graduated from the school and now attends KIPP Bayview Academy, a highly regarded charter nearby, said the staff members excel at helping to place students at good middle schools.\nBut Diane Gray, the executive director of the Bayview Association for Youth, which offers academic support to students in the area, says the school needs to do a better job of promoting itself. Gray pointed to other San Francisco schools that she said have been successful in diversifying their populations to reflect their evolving neighborhoods by targeting preschools, looping in middle-class parents, working aggressively with developers, getting their names on brochures and fact-sheets, and encouraging teachers to attend community meetings. \"I have no doubt that the same thing can happen here,\" she said. \"But there has to be a lot of work done on both sides of the fence.\"\nAcross the country, efforts to integrate public schools and keep them integrated have been fraught. Many school districts are finding themselves rapidly resegregating once released from federal desegregation orders put in place in the '70s and '80s, dipping back to pre-Civil Rights-era segregation numbers. San Francisco was released from its race-based federal desegregation order in 2001, and though it's tried to promote more integration with a race-neutral school-choice program, it's gotten mixed results.\nIn 2005, former San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom added a new post to his staff: a special advisor to address issues related to education and families. Hydra Mendoza, who has held the post for the past decade, also sits on the school board, working to create collaborations between the city's housing authority and its school district, keeping key officials apprised of new developments, and telling them about development plans that might present opportunities to improve struggling schools. \"We're building stronger ties between the school district and the city,\" she said.\nBut no one thinks turning Malcolm X into a coveted school will be easy. The school's poor academic performance makes it a hard sell to middle-income parents: The number of students proficient in reading dipped from 48 percent to 25 percent between 2011 and 2013, with math proficiency seeing a similar dip. The school lost more than 17 percent of its student body between 2009 and 2014, and according to teachers some of those who remain are homeless or living in unstable conditions. Teachers believe the construction in the neighborhood is partially to blame for the decline in enrollment because it forced some families to relocate. The first-grade teacher Anthony Arinwine says the loss of students and the poor test scores have given the school a branding problem, even with longtime Bayview residents: \"It has a lot of reputation to overcome,\" he said.\nBut for Ray McClenter, who finished fourth grade this spring and recently moved into one of the new Bayview apartments with his family, there is much to be gained if the city can lure newcomers to the struggling school. \"If more kids come,\" he said, \"I can make new friends.\"\nReprinted with permission from The Atlantic .

Nothing resembling actual confirmation was produced afterward, and many questioned the value or impact of eliminating what was for all intents and purposes merely a figurehead.\nHowever, Western audiences have a shrinking attention span coupled with a growing awareness that everything they see on the news is likely at the very least, \u2018spun.\u2019 Despite this skepticism, US and European news services insist on serving up intelligence-insulting narratives seemingly designed for the minds of children, not educated, informed adults.\nSo just as Jihadi John\u2019s memory began to fade from the collective narrative the US and European media pummels its audiences with daily, Jihadi John version 2.0 has been introduced. This IS doppelganger denizen appears almost identical to his predecessor, with the only difference being his brandishing of a pistol instead of a combat knife.\nAn English-speaking child, and a British-sounding militant who brings to mind ISIS\u2019 previous propagandist, \u2018Jihadi John,\u2019 appear in the latest, chilling propaganda video from ISIS.\nIn the video, which has not yet been independently verified, the child says that the group will kill \u201ckuffar\u2019 \u2014 nonbelievers \u2014 \u201cover there,\u201d referring to the West, while the adult threatens and insults British Prime Minister David Cameron.\nThe speaker\u2019s accent and dress bring to mind the previous \u2014 masked \u2014 face of the terror group, Mohammed Emwazi, otherwise known as \u201cJihadi John.\u201d Emwazi was understood to have been killed in Raqqa late last year in an airstrike which specifically targeted the Briton. His absence lends credence to Western intelligence agencies\u2019 belief that he is indeed dead.\nJihadi John 2.0 is still narrating IS\u2019 high-value productions, which include gruesome executions, and the US and European media is still using him as the very convenient, extremely easy-to-hate face of IS. That Jihadi John 2.0 is taunting British Prime Minister David Cameron, is highly suspicious, considering that the British have been \u201cfighting\u201d IS for over a month now, but have conducted only 3 airstrikes, versus dozens of strikes daily by Russia accompanied by offensives carried out by a reinvigorated Syrian military on multiple fronts.\nIt\u2019s almost as if this cartoon character, Jihadi John, is meant to intentionally offend Western sensibilities, provoking support for an otherwise unpopular and unjustifiable foreign military adventure in a country the US and UK do not otherwise belong meddling in.\nWho is Jihadi John 2.0? Who Knows? Who Cares?\nUltimately, it doesn\u2019t matter who any of the incarnations of Jihadi John are. The role this figurehead plays in IS\u2019 overall operation is actually superficial at best, and under closer scrutiny, aiding and abetting US and European meddling in the region by providing an overly obvious justification to continually perpetuate geopolitical dynamics in the region aimed at transforming the Middle East into a shape more suitable to Western interests.\nThat the United States invested time, money, and energy into allegedly killing \u201cJihadi John,\u201d instead of identifying, exposing, and dismantling IS\u2019 logistical networks, including those stretching into NATO territory itself in Turkey, seems to indicate the US is not serious at all about actually fighting or stopping IS, and instead, just interested in appearing to do so.\nThat CNN thinks this is a story instead of asking just why the US is not trying to get to the bottom of IS\u2019 source of money, supplies, weapons, fighters and political support, tells you that CNN is not interested in journalism, but like Jihadi John himself (selves?) they are nothing more than propagandists attempting to manipulate, not inform the public\u2019s perception."

We asked our critics, Greg Kot, Howard Reich and John von Rhein, to lay out their summer of festival goodness.\nLocal classical music buffs get to hear world-class performances week after week at the area's \"Big Two\" summer fests, the Grant Park Music Festival in downtown Chicago, and the Ravinia Festival in north suburban Highland Park. That's not something you should take for granted.\nTo help you navigate the hot-weather bounty, we have singled out five events at each festival that look unusually promising from this distance. Go and enjoy!\nBerlioz's \"Romeo et Juliette\": Complete performances of this strange and wonderful dramatic symphony are rare in Chicago, so these concerts, led by principal conductor Carlos Kalmar, are to be eagerly anticipated. June 13-14. Note that the venue has been shifted to the Auditorium Theater to avoid conflicting with the nearby Chicago Blues Festival.\nGrant Park Chorus: The annual a cappella choral program by director Christopher Bell's remarkable ensemble once again includes intriguing 20th century repertory you don't get to hear very often. July 17 at South Shore Cultural Center, 7059 S. South Shore Drive; and July 20 at Columbus Park Refectory, 5701 W. Jackson Blvd.\nLeonard Slatkin: The festival's former principal conductor returns to lead contrasting rarities by Dmitri Shostakovich and the Dominican composer and pianist Michel Camilo. July 25-26.\nNational Youth Orchestra of the U.S.: David Robertson conducts the ensemble, which is made up of some of America's finest young instrumentalists, with the Illinois-born violin virtuoso Gil Shaham as soloist. July 28.\n\"The Legend of the Northern Lights\": Inspired by a children's story about the origins of the aurora borealis, Christopher Theofanidis' symphonic work will be accompanied by a film by Jose Francisco Salgado that incorporates NASA and Canadian Space Agency images. World premiere. Aug. 8-9.\nSusanna Malkki leads the Chicago Symphony Orchestra: Amid the movie, Broadway and pops nights crowding the 78th CSO residency, this concert stands out. The highly regarded Finnish conductor will be making her Ravinia debut, and her soloist in a Tchaikovsky-Prokofiev program will be the superb violinist Midori, who joins the Ravinia Steans Music Institute faculty this summer. July 16.\nStrauss' \"Salome\": The first of music director James Conlon's three operas with the CSO this summer should almost make up for the orchestra's relatively scant attention to Richard Strauss' 150th birthday anniversary during the winter season. Patricia Racette will sing her first Salome, with Egils Silins, Wolfgang Schmidt and Gabriele Schnaut in other leading roles. Aug. 2.\nChicago Pro Musica: The multi-talented Hershey Felder is back, this time as director, presiding over stagings of Stravinsky's wry fable \"The Soldier's Tale\" and a sequel, \"The Devil's Tale,\" by composer James Stephenson. Aug. 5, Martin Theatre.\nMozart's \"Don Giovanni\" and \"The Marriage of Figaro\": There are few more alluring combo-pacs under the summer sun than Conlon, Mozart, the CSO and the intimate Martin Theatre. The casts are pretty alluring too. Christopher Maltman will portray the dissolute Don, with Tamara Wilson, Aga Mikolaj and Ailyn Perez as the women in Giovanni's life. The servants and their masters in \"Figaro\" include John Relyea, Lisette Oropesa, Soile Isokoski, Stephane Degout and Renee Rapier.

        "output": "gas.\nIt was the last flight of Lynyrd Skynyrd: Oct. 20, 1977, the night they drove Ol' Dixie down.\nThe band had risen out of Jacksonville on the wings of such anthems as \"Free Bird\" and \"Sweet Home Alabama.\" But just as they were beginning to reach their zenith, the Skynyrd boys would go down with the sun, plunging into the southern Mississippi countryside in a plane crash that would kill Van Zant; guitarist Steve Gaines; his sister, backup vocalist Cassie Gaines; and road manager Dean Kilpatrick.\n\"We were cut off right in the middle of our stride,\" drummer Artimus Pyle says.\nIf you believe in omens, there were plenty: flames shooting from an engine on a previous flight, a just-released album featuring a song about \"the smell of death,\" Van Zant's own premonition that he would die young. But it wasn't supposed to happen so soon.\n\"It was a real pleasant flight, and I remember it to this day, to this second,\" Powell, the Skynyrd keyboard player, recalls. \"I looked at my watch when we were going down. It was 6:48 p.m., and there was a beautiful horizon. The sun was going down, and I had like a panoramic view of a beautiful sunset. It was just as peaceful as all get-out. We were playing cards, and everybody was just doing their own thing.\"\nIt was only days after the release of the Street Survivors album -- whose cover showed the group engulfed in flames -- and the Skynyrd band, which had just begun a nationwide tour, was on its way to Baton Rouge, La., from the previous night's performance in Greenville, S.C.\nTwo days earlier, on a flight from Lakeland to Greenville, guitarist Allen Collins reported seeing a 10-foot flame shooting out of the right engine of the chartered Convair 240.\n\"When Collins got on, he was sitting there going, 'Man, this ain't right,' \" Rossington adds. \"He knew.\"\nThe group decided the flight to Baton Rouge would be one of Skynyrd's last in the 30-year-old aircraft. The hardest-working band in America deserved better and was planning to switch planes a few days later in Dallas.\n\"We had talked about that an hour before we went down,\" Pyle remembers. \"We had decided to get a Learjet for the band, a beautiful bus for the crew. It was ridiculous for us to be on an old plane like that.\"\nAt 6:42 p.m., according to a National Transportation Safety Board investigation of the crash, the Convair's flight crew radioed the Houston Air Traffic Control Center and reported the plane was low on fuel: \"Yes, sir, we need to get to a airport, the closest airport you've got, sir.\"\nBut they'd already flown over the closest airport, in McComb, Miss., and co-pilot William Gray told the 24 passengers to strap in, that the plane was running on empty and an emergency landing was imminent. They hoped to belly- flop in a muddy field a few miles to the south.\n\"I was real proud of everybody,\" Powell says. \"Instead of panicking, everybody was sitting there praying.\"\nPyle, who like Powell is a pilot, instructed the other passengers in the proper crash procedure. \"I told everybody to put out their cigarettes and turn out all the lights and bend over,\" Pyle says. \"I did the stewardess trip.\" Then he went to the cockpit.\n\"The pilot, Walter McCreary, turned around and looked at me and said, 'Go back to the fuselage and strap yourself in,' \" Pyle says. \"And I could see fear. . . . I could see death in the man's eyes. He was a good pilot, but he kind of freaked a little bit. Nothing like that had ever happened to him.\"\nOn his way back to the cabin, Pyle met Van Zant, and they grasped each other's hands.\n\"Ronnie Van Zant walked to the back of the plane to get a pillow, and as he walked forward, he shook my hand,\" Pyle says. \"We looked at each other and smiled, and he continued forward and sat down. Ronnie knew that he was going to die.\"\nVan Zant took a seat between Collins and Rossington. Across from them, in facing seats, were Gaines, his sister and Kilpatrick. Of the six, only Rossington and Collins would survive.\nPowell buckled in next to production manager Clayton Johnson. Johnson joked that this would be his last \"low-budget tour.\" Powell prayed that it wouldn't.\nAlmost 10 minutes elapsed from the first warning until the eventual crash, Powell says. It was as if he were standing on a gallows, waiting to hear the executioner's song.\n\"I was going, 'We're fixing to die, man.' I said, 'God, please don't take my life.' . . . I can't describe the feeling that was going through me, knowing that I was fixing to die.\"\nThe Convair came down at a 5-degree angle that grew steeper after the initial impact with the treetops. As it sliced its way through the timber, the plane cut a 500-foot path.\n\"I remember we started clipping those pine trees, and I heard a real loud cracking noise,\" Powell says. \"The crash itself only lasted about 15 seconds at the most. . . . It felt like being rolled down a hill in a garbage can and being hit by about a hundred baseball bats at the same time. That's the only way I can explain it.\"\nThe estimated time of the crash, according to the NTSB report, was 6:52 p.m. It occurred a few miles outside of Gillsburg, Miss., a blink-and- you'll-miss-it crossroads just north of the Mississippi-Louisiana line. Including both pilots, six people died. Twenty survived.\nOf the survivors, Rossington, Collins, bassist Leon Wilkeson and backup vocalist Leslie Hawkins were the most critically injured. Powell and Pyle were two of the most fortunate.\n\"I remember my seat belt breaking, and I crashed through a table face- first,\" Powell says. He felt for his nose and found it on the side of his face, but he remained conscious.\n\"I walked out of the fuselage, and the cockpit was gone, both wings were gone and the tail section was gone, just crushed to pieces,\" he says. \"I sat on top of the airplane, which was turned sideways. I just sat there for a while, going, 'What has happened?' And I was crying.\n\"I jumped off and there were people screaming. I remember hearing Leon screaming, 'Get me out of here.' People that were still in the fuselage were trapped by seats and debris and metal and stuff. I just walked around trying to help whoever I could. I took my T-shirt off and I was holding my nose on with that.\"\nPyle, a former Marine, had noticed the plane's path as it was descending and kept an eye out for any sign of civilization. Although he suffered cracked ribs in the crash, he managed to run for help, along with road-crew members Ken Peden and Mark Frank.\n\"I made my way through a swamp,\" Pyle says. \"The impact of the crash had knocked my shoes off and my socks were hanging over my toes about six inches, but my chest was so broken up, I couldn't bend over to pull my socks up. It was very hard to walk through the briars and the brambles. . . .\n\"I got up in the front yard of this house, and this guy -- his name was Johnny Mote, and I'll never forget him -- he had a shotgun and he pointed it at me. Then he put it up in the air and fired it 'cause I was covered with blood and he thought I was an escaped convict. When he did, I fell to the ground and I yelled, 'Plane crash.' And he ran to me and helped me to my feet.\"\nWhile Pyle navigated, Mote drove to the crash site with a caravan of pickups and four-wheelers in tow. \"He put me in a pickup truck, man, and said, 'You point to where you came out of the swamp.' . . . This guy drove right through the fences, across the road, through the ditch, and I'm looking behind us, and there's like all these vehicles following us through the mud.\" Mote, a dairy farmer, was bailing hay when the twilight crash occurred. He and his workers heard the noise but thought it was an automobile wreck. \"It sounded like a car sliding in gravel or something,\" Mote says. \"We drove up and down the road hunting it, and we couldn't find anything, so we went on back in the field and started working. It was just beginning to get dark.\"\nMote says it was \"a good 20 minutes, maybe 30 minutes\" before help arrived.\n\"I had heard it,\" Mote says, \"but I didn't know what it was. If I had known what it was, I could have got there as soon as it crashed. I could have driven right to it.\n\"If they had gone another 100 yards, they would have landed in my field, but they just didn't quite make it.\"\nMote wasn't prepared for what he saw.\n\"When we first got down there, you could hear them whining,\" he says. \"Some of them were crying and hollering. It got to me.\"\nA neighboring farmer, Dwain Easley, helped lift the bodies out of the wreckage. \"To me, it looked like everybody in there was all on top of each other, packed in there,\" Easley says. \"As we pulled people off the top, we found people underneath those people. I never had seen anything like that.\"\nThe rescue operation became a community effort. In addition to the local citizens, the Pike County Civil Defense Council, the Pike County Sheriffs' Department, the Amite County Sheriffs' Department, the Mississippi Highway Patrol, the Southwest Mississippi Regional Medical Center and the U.S. Coast Guard assisted in the rescue operation.\n\"I just remember waking up in a field with the helicopters over us, with their search lights shining on us,\" Rossington says. \"I've been somewhere lately where a helicopter came over with them lights and it just freaked me out. I can remember that feeling, and I felt like shooting it down or something.\"\n\"The injuries were such that every single second counted because every single second there were people losing blood,\" Pyle says. \"To me, it's a miracle that a plane that crashed in the manner that we did, and the tiny little pieces of garbage that the plane ended up being, it's just a miracle that 20 people lived through it, that only six people were killed.\"\nIt was because of Pyle's instincts that more lives were spared, Powell says.\n\"I can say to this day, honestly, Artimus Pyle, thanks to him and Kenny Peden, that they saved more lives,\" Powell says. \"Thanks to Artimus, the townspeople came. And they came on foot and pulled people out one by one and put us in different cars and trucks and stuff and took us to the emergency rooms.\n\"If he didn't run for help, then more people would have died from loss of blood, like Leon. He was dead on arrival at the hospital, and they pumped blood back into him and brought him back to life -- twice. But he would have definitely died in just a few more minutes from loss of blood. It was scary, the scariest thing I've ever experienced.\"\nPyle feels it was God's will that he was saved.\n\"There were no heroes, man,\" he says. \"I went for help, yeah. . . . I really felt like God spared me to do that, but I certainly wasn't a hero. It had nothing to do with that.\"\nWilkeson, who suffered a broken jaw, a crushed chest and internal bleeding, was rushed to a hospital in nearby McComb. Rossington, Collins and Hawkins were transported to hospitals in Jackson. Powell and Pyle were taken to hospitals in Jackson and Magnolia respectively and were released the week following the crash.\nPowell was the only survivor who was able to attend Van Zant's memorial service in Jacksonville five days later. Steve and Cassie Gaines were buried in their hometown of Miami, Okla., two days earlier.\nThe probable cause of the crash, according to the NTSB report, was \"fuel exhaustion and total loss of power from both engines due to crew inattention to fuel supply.\"\nThe report added: \"Contributing to the fuel exhaustion were inadequate flight planning and an engine malfunction of undetermined nature in the right engine, which resulted in higher-than-normal fuel consumption.\"\nThe Convair had taken on an additional 400 gallons of fuel before departing Greenville at 5:30 EDT on the evening of the crash. According to pilot McCreary's flight plan, the trip to Baton Rouge was to take two hours and 45 minutes. Including the supply added in Greenville, the plane had five hours' worth of fuel on board. When it crashed more than two hours later, it was carrying a single quart. Because so little fuel was on board, the plane did not go up in flames on impact, which helped save more lives, the NTSB report says.\nThe report, issued in June 1978, concludes that the fuel supply was exhausted because the right engine -- the one from which Collins had reported seeing flames earlier -- was burning more fuel than anticipated because it was being operated in the \"auto-rich\" fuel mode, which increases consumption.\nThe report adds: \"The crew was either negligent or ignorant of the increased fuel consumption because they failed to monitor adequately the engine instruments for fuel flow and fuel quantity.\n\"Had they properly monitored their fuel supply and noted excessive fuel consumption early in the flight, they could have planned an alternate refueling stop rather than attempting to continue the flight with minimum fuel.\n\"In addition, the Safety Board believes that the pilot was not prudent when he continued the flight with a known engine discrepancy and did not have it corrected before he left Greenville.\"\nBetween them, McCreary and co-pilot Gray had logged more than 9,000 hours of flight time, but only 106 of those hours were in the Convair.\nRossington, though, blames no one for what happened.\n\"There's a million 'maybes' and 'ifs' and 'should haves,' \" he says. \"But what happened has already happened. It didn't matter what caused it. It was unfortunate, but it happened. After the fact, to learn why, it doesn't really do anything to you.\"\nAlthough he acknowledges pilot error, Pyle says the band's management and the band itself were just as responsible for the crash.\n\"We should have had better transportation,\" he says. \"The cheapness ended up taking us down.\n\"The reason we crashed was as much our fault as it was anybody's fault,\" he adds. \"And I don't think anybody in the band would dispute that. We can be held to blame as much as our management, as much as neglect on anybody else's part. We were so happy to have those gigs to go to, like any rock 'n' roll band is really glad to have a gig. And we lost sight of how we were getting there.\n\"There were a lot of people on the plane that knew something was wrong,\" he says. \"But we all kind of followed each other, and that's where we made our mistake.\n\"With our management neglect and our own neglect, it added up to a plane crash, and we had one.\"\nFor Powell, the emotional scars left by the crash cut deeper and crueler than the physical ones.\n\"I wondered when the airplane crash happened what I was doing alive,\" he says. \"I blamed it on God: He took my career away from me. And I went into a deep state of depression for about a year. I hit the bottle real heavy.\"\nThree years after the crash, Rossington, Collins, Powell and Wilkeson reunited to form the Rossington-Collins Band. Beset by personal problems -- including the death of Collins' wife, Kathy -- the group broke up after two albums for MCA.\n\"We were still pretty bitter that Ronnie was gone and Steve was gone and Cassie was gone and Dean was gone,\" Powell says. \"The drinking and drugs got heavier during the Rossington-Collins Band than ever.\"\nRossington has tried to put the crash behind him, and it's been only in the past months -- since the surviving band members announced plans for a Lynyrd Skynyrd tribute tour -- that he's talked candidly about it.\n\"For that to happen was such a shock,\" he says. \"We were real close and we were like brothers. We weren't like a band that just got together when we played. We lived together and fished together and hung out together.\n\"We had our act together, and we were doing good and we were happy and Ronnie had just had a new baby,\" Rossington says. \"It was just real bad timing. . . . I didn't ever -- until today -- come to terms with it. It's just something you learn to live with.\"\nSince the crash, Rossington has married Dale Krantz, who sang vocals in the Rossington-Collins Band, and they've moved to Wyoming, where they have two babies, Mary and Annie, and a log cabin in the shadow of the Grand Tetons. Family life, Rossington says, has helped him deal with the memories of 10 years ago.\n\"It makes me know I had a reason to keep on living,\" he says. \"If I would have died, Mary and Annie wouldn't be here. It's kind of funny how your fate ends up. The people who died, I see their ex-wives and families have changed. They've gone on their ways.\n\"It's 10 years later,\" he adds. \"You've got to go on with life. Everybody would be crazy if they thought about all the bad stuff.\""

Our community is in crisis over the deaths and overdoses that are a direct result of substance use.\nI am probably one of the very few who have never personally been affected by opioid",
        "output": "use. I have not lost a family member, a friend or a loved one due to drugs. Some would argue that years ago, I would have thought I was too good to know someone who was addicted. If you\u2019re one of those people who think that you\u2019re too good to be associated with someone who suffers from addiction, I\u2019m sorry for you.\nAddiction doesn\u2019t discriminate like we do. It\u2019s natural to develop a jaded sense of reality over time. Lived experience tells us to become hardened to a problem, yet, contradicts human nature of lived experience bringing us to our knees.\nI consider myself a privileged woman who grew up in Harford County, attended private schools, attained a college degree and never really had to work too hard to excel. I am one of the lucky ones to make it out unscathed. So far.\nEven though I have not been affected by opioid use, alcohol is a different story. My first experiences with those battling addiction wasn\u2019t until I began working in a restaurant at age 15.\nNight after night, I saw the same faces walk through the door headed straight for the bar. They were regulars and I loved them like friends. We laughed over drags off cigarettes \u2014 back when you could smoke in a bar \u2014 and they usually stayed well after closing.\nFast forward a few years when I received a phone call to inform me that one of my favorite bar regulars had died. His body had succumbed to the years of alcohol flowing freely in his system. I was heartbroken. The next year, another favorite died. The next year, one more.\nToday, most of my beloved bar regulars have passed. I helped feed their addiction. I didn\u2019t know they couldn\u2019t say no and I didn\u2019t know they were suffering. Never once did I think about their health because I was only concerned with the money I took home every night from their tips. After all, I was saving for a spanking new pair of UGGs. I was clueless. For my adored bar regulars, they were not so clueless. The struggle was real.\nNaturally, my life experiences expanded and I was more exposed to those who suffered from substance use. I worked at a company that provided counseling to Department of Transportation employees who tested positive for substances. To say that job was eye opening is an understatement. I quickly learned what a hold addiction had on people. Yet again, my life experiences grew and I began working at the Harford County Health Department.\nThree years ago, I was lucky enough to attend Harford County\u2019s first Opioid Town Hall meeting at the college. Being pregnant at the time, already scared about what was ahead of me, I saw mothers stand and fight back tears while saying \u201cheroin killed my child.\u201d At that moment, a whole new fear was introduced into my already terrified mind. The stories of beautiful children who were good kids with promising futures, who were part of a loving family and an active member of society were dead. No one in that room thought they would endure the pain of losing someone to something so deadly.\nTo the mothers courageously sharing their story, that meeting was a safe place. There was no judgement, just compassion. Something that someone struggling with addiction is rarely greeted with. The stigma associated with a struggle as serious as addiction was something that the community was trying to transform that night.\nAt that time, I witnessed the power of community affected by the power of addiction. Sadly, this was only the beginning of the crisis in Harford County.\nSometimes it feels like our work is done but the staggering number of deaths posted on the board outside our Sheriff\u2019s Office is a reminder that we need to work harder. That number doesn\u2019t reflect how many lives were saved because of treatment and education. Or because of the love and compassion that we gave to those who needed us. Because no one is immune to being affected by drugs or alcohol.\nTo work in a community where there is an abundance of partnerships and passion to save the lives of our neighbors, friends and family is beyond rewarding \u2014 it\u2019s humbling. From the Health Department, to the Sheriff\u2019s Office, to the Town of Bel Air, to County Government, to the hospital, to the school system, to all the recovery programs\u2026the list of partnerships is longer than you can imagine.\nDay in and day out, our community is working around the clock to raise awareness, hoping to save the lives of someone who is struggling. Millions of dollars are being spent. Blood, sweat and tears are being poured into the belief that recovery is possible. Recovery IS possible. There are resources available to anyone who needs them.\nFor those who are in need of help, I have a message for you: YOU CAN DO IT. No one will judge you. No one will turn you away. You matter to us and to our community. We need you to stay here with us to help fight a fight that\u2019s worth fighting for.\nMolly Mraz is communications director and public information officer for the Harford County Health Department."

Many employers contribute to employees\u2019 HSA accounts \u2014 and because this type of spending account doesn\u2019t expire, you can keep it through retirement and use it as an extra savings fund. Learn what an HSA is and if it benefits your financial situation.\nLearn what an HSA is and how it can benefit your financial situation so that you can find ways to survive rising healthcare costs.\nAn HSA is a tax-free savings account designed to help qualified individuals offset healthcare costs. HSA enrollees must be covered by insurance plans with high deductibles. As a cost-saving measure, many businesses are encouraging employees to enroll in high-deductible plans and pair them with HSAs.\nHow Does an HSA Work?\nYou make pretax contributions to an employer-sponsored HSA and your contributions are tax-deductible if you have an individual HSA. You can make tax-free withdrawals from your HSA for medical expenses at any time.\nAnnual HSA contribution limits for 2017 are $3,400 for individuals and $6,750 for families. If you\u2019re 55 or older you can make an extra $1,000 as a \u201ccatch-up\u201d contribution each year. You can contribute to an HSA until Tax Day.\nAlthough you don\u2019t need IRS authorization to establish an HSA, there are several eligibility requirements and governing rules you must follow. You must be enrolled in a high-deductible health plan, which for 2017 translates to plan with a $1,300 deductible for individuals and $2,600 for families. Because not all high-deductible plans are eligible for HSAs, it\u2019s important to choose one that is.\nTo be eligible for an HSA, no other taxpayer can claim you as a dependent on his returns. In addition, you cannot be enrolled in Medicare or have any supplemental health coverage.\nQualifying trustees must establish HSAs. Examples of these might include insurance companies, banks and IRS-approved individuals.\nMany businesses work with a designated HSA administrator but you can choose any qualified trustee to open and manage your account. It often pays to go with your employer\u2019s administrator, however, because otherwise you might miss out on valuable employer contributions and experience longer claims processing times, according to Kiplinger.\nIf you decide to enroll in an HSA on your own, check HSASearch.com to find a plan. The site provides advanced search functions that enable you to compare more than 350 HSA administrators.\nTo better decide whether an HSA is right for your financial strategy, understand the advantages and disadvantages of this type of savings account.\nHSAs come with a wide variety of attractive benefits. Decide if they are tempting enough for you to enroll in a plan.\nYou can withdraw funds tax-free to pay for healthcare, your money grows tax-deferred until you use it and you don\u2019t pay taxes on the money you contribute.\nYou have no deadline for eligible withdrawals and you keep your tax-deferred contributions until you use them.\nMost insurers have a streamlined system for easy record keeping and medical billing.\nIf you change jobs, there is no complicated HSA rollover process.\nAn HSA can double as a supplementary retirement account.\nMany employers contribute to their employees\u2019 plans.\nAll out-of-pocket medical expenses qualify, including co-pays.\nHSAs have a few drawbacks, too. See if any of these is a deal breaker for you.\nWithdrawals for non-medical purposes are subject to a 20 percent penalty plus taxes.\nHSA administrators and trustees charge maintenance fees.\nYour contributions might not cover all your medical expenses.\nIf you have a high-deductible insurance plan and expect considerable medical expenses, an HSA could be a good choice for you.\nLearn how to get the best savings account for your needs."

        "input": "I didn\u2019t want to watch it. It was everything that I feared it would be\u2026boring, excruciating, and mind-numbing. But nevertheless, I sat through almost the entire 90 minutes of the Presidential debate last Thursday evening and endured it all\u2026the lies, the deceit, and the evasions. The viewers were exposed to",
        "output": "so much toxic BS that I found myself scanning my living room for a HazMat suit.\nWhile it may have been painful for me, the experience must have been positively agonizing for President Bush. He stood on the podium, dumb-founded, while John Kerry ripped his Iraq adventure to shreds. It didn\u2019t appear that Bush had ever been aggressively exposed to a real dissection of his war up until this contest. He seemed to be angered that anyone could have the impudence to question his policies, much less excoriate them.\nAgain and again, Bush retaliated by accusing Kerry of vacillation of his opinions. As he did so, I kept being reminded of that famous quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson: \"A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of a little mind.\" And President Bush is nothing if not consistent. It is inconceivable to me that anyone could still think that this invasion was a good idea. But apparently President Bush does.\nOverall, I must confess to a certain schadenfreude during this whole affair. Seeing Bush squirm was my sole pleasure of the evening\u2026one of the few that I\u2019ve had since this awful campaign began.\nAlthough watching Bush stumble and mumble may have been amusing, I was much more alarmed by Senator Kerry\u2019s performance. I was awed by the ease with which he slithered around his past foreign policy positions and shed his skin to reveal a shiny new antiwar paint-job.\nBut we cannot allow ourselves to take our eyes off of the ball. Specifically, three issues surrounding Kerry\u2019s debating points were most disturbing and need to be further examined.\n#1 Where was Kerry when it mattered most?\nAs much as he may attempt to rationalize his actions, Senator Kerry voted in favor of the Iraq War resolution. Why he did so remains a matter of opinion. My hunch is that he opposed an attack on Iraq, but was intimidated by the overwhelming support that the invasion had amongst the post-9/11 masses. They were howling for blood, and Kerry was simply unwilling to stand up and speak the truth.\nLeadership is about stating your convictions even when it hurts and even when it might be unpopular. In the months leading up to this war, America was in desperate need of a national political figure who was willing to lay his career on the line and speak out against this unfolding tragedy.\nSenator Kerry was not that man. When the going got tough, he followed the path of least resistance.\nAnd even more annoying, he has attempted to parse the issue of his vote with murky legalisms. He repeated his belief that prudence required that the president be given authority to invade Iraq, and he claims that he had no idea that Bush would attack with such haste and in such a reckless manner.\nEveryone on the planet knew that Bush was champing at the bit to invade Iraq. And everyone knew that he was going to use the congressional resolution as political cover to do so. Kerry\u2019s weasel-words notwithstanding, his explanation doesn\u2019t hold water.\nThe time to stop this atrocity was before the invasion, before the deaths, and before the expenditure of hundreds of billions of taxpayers\u2019 money. Kerry laid out a beautiful case for the inanity of the invasion, but he was a day late and a dollar short.\nAnd furthermore, why does he still believe that Bush should have been given congressional authority to invade Iraq? Iraq did not attack America. Iraq was not threatening to attack America. Iraq was not involved in 9/11, and it had only tenuous connections to Islamist terror organizations.\nGiven these facts, by what standard does Kerry still believe that the war resolution was the right thing to do?\nAnd this opens a Pandora\u2019s Box of additional questions. Are there any other nations that Kerry thinks congress should permit the president to invade? Syria? Iran? North Korea? If the target of the war needs not be a direct threat to America, then exactly what criteria does Senator Kerry use to decide who gets invaded and who doesn\u2019t? And why did he vote for a war resolution when he didn\u2019t think that it should actually be carried out?\nHis entire approach to this issue is awash in non-sequiturs. He was molting and morphing right before our very eyes. Had it been about anything less crucial, it would have been funny.\n#2 What\u2019s the deal with Kerry\u2019s alleged \"plan\"?\nDespite long, entertaining dissertations on the foolishness of invading Iraq, Kerry does not really have any legitimate ideas on how to end the conflict. It is one thing to run from his war vote and trash Bush\u2019s performance\u2026but what are we going to do now?\nThe obvious answer, in my opinion, is to withdraw the troops immediately and allow the Iraqis to sort this mess out for themselves. The country may well fall apart, but our staying there will only continue to make the situation even worse.\nBut Kerry absolutely rejects a withdrawal. He stated flatly, \"I\u2019m not talking about leaving, I\u2019m talking about winning.\"\nBut how does he define \"win\"?\nBack in his anti-Vietnam War days, Kerry famously asked, \"How do you ask men to continue to die for a mistake?\" That is a very good question. If he now admits that this war is a debacle which was carried out under false pretenses, how can he rationalize keeping troops there even for another minute, much less into the indefinite future?\nAnd since he discards the possibility of a withdrawal, what are his specific ideas about prosecuting the conflict?\nThe only things that I\u2019ve heard from him are banalities that are already being tried by Bush. Kerry wants to bring more allies into the war. But France and Germany have already said that they will not send troops, regardless of who wins the election. Realistically, what sane nation would go there now given the situation on the ground? Kerry says he wants to train indigenous forces. But Bush is already doing that, albeit poorly. And it is doubtful that Kerry will be able to make these forces into any more of an efficient military than Bush has.\nIn essence, Kerry\u2019s ideas are more of the same failed ones already being implemented by the president.\nThe bottom line is that if Kerry believes that the war is as big of a disaster as he vividly described on Thursday, then there is no legitimate moral justification for keeping our troops there. Period.\nSenator Kerry spent most of the debate skewering Bush\u2019s Iraq policy. But he also touched on several other brewing crises. Most specifically, he ruminated about the ongoing weapons programs in Iran and North Korea. While he was berating President Bush for not doing anything about these \"rogue nations,\" I was left in a rhetorical whipsaw. How on earth can he complain about Bush invading Iraq, ostensibly to rid that nation of WMDs, and simultaneously clamor for urgent action to prevent Iran and North Korea from further developing these very same weapons?\nHe again lapsed into banalities about bilateral negotiations and sanctions, but does anyone really believe that North Korea cares about written agreements? If Kerry thinks that it is intolerable that these nations should develop WMDs, then exactly how does he plan to stop them if they ignore negotiations? Will he go to war? And if so, how does that make him different from Bush in Iraq?\nIn short, does Kerry believe that we have the right to invade sovereign nations on the suspicion of WMD development alone? If so, then how can he criticize Bush\u2019s invasion of Iraq? If not, then how does he propose to stop these other nations from building the weapons that he has flatly stated they must not to be permitted to possess?\nAfter moving on from WMDs, the issue of the Sudan appeared. Kerry was asked what, if anything, he thinks should be done about the ethnic conflict in Darfur. While expressing the usual hope that \"US troops don\u2019t need to go\" and that the \"African Union would take care of the situation,\" Kerry implied that he would send American troops to the Sudan if things deteriorated and no one else picked up the ball.\nI nearly fell from my chair. Did we learn nothing in Somalia? How on earth can Kerry spend an hour trashing Bush for trying to \"build democracy\" in Iraq, and then quickly turn around and suggest the possibility of a \"nation building\" escapade in the Sudan?\nAnd this is the ultimate crux of the matter. Neither of these candidates is opposed to overseas adventurism. As best I can tell, Kerry\u2019s major complaint about Iraq is that it was a Republican who launched the war. Assertions of what is in the best interest of the American people have almost dropped off the radar screen entirely. Apparently, Kerry is OK with sending US troops into a Sudanese meat grinder if the excuses are more PC than Bush\u2019s Iraq ones.\nNear the end of the debate, Jim Lehrer asked both candidates what is the most urgent national security concern for the United States. Both men replied that it was the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\nI disagree. From what I\u2019ve seen over the past several years, the correct answer to that question is the insane ideology of military interventionism that has captivated the elites across both political parties. No Americans have died from nuclear or biological weapons. But this manic series of wars, either of the rightist/imperialist or the leftist/nanny-state variety, has already killed over 1000 Americans in Iraq, plus dozens more in Somalia, Panama, Haiti, etc\u2026 going all the way back to the 58,000 who fell in Vietnam. And there is no end in sight.\nRegardless of who wins this election, the only certainty is that there will be continued war in various locales, and that American soldiers will continue to die even as America sinks into bankruptcy.\nPeople shouldn\u2019t delude themselves into thinking that this election represents a season of renewal. Judging from what I saw in the debate, more of the same is on the way.\nHurray for Burt Rutan and Paul Allen: Now It's Time to Deep-Six NASA!!!"

Microsoft announced plans recently to bring the Xbox One exclusive game Quantum Break, developed by Remedy Software, to Windows Store on launch day. Other games such as Gears of Wars Ultimate Edition and Fable Legends are also lined up to be Store exclusives.\nThe games will only be available for Microsoft's game console and through Windows Store, and Microsoft will use the same strategy to push Windows Store by making other games it has control over as Store exclusives.\nThis is beneficial to PC gamers on first glance as they gain access to games that they would not be able to play at all on the platform or only after years of delay.\nBut what about games that are available on other PC stores or even retail channels? Are there differences between Universal Platform versions of games and regular desktop versions of said games?\nIf you compare the Windows Store version of Rise of the Tomb Raider with the Steam version, you will notice that there are huge differences between both versions.\nA thread on Reddit was the first to highlight major differences between Windows Store games and regular PC games.\nWindows Store games cannot run in exclusive fullscreen mode right now.\nYou may notice that this benefits Alt-Tabbing out of games as the switch to other programs or apps is instant, but it does come with a slight drop in performance usually and it enforces Vsync on top of that.\nThe main purpose of Vsync is to prevent screen tearing in games. Both AMD and NVIDIA introduced better methods to avoid screen tearing in games, namely FreeSync and G-Sync.\nUnfortunately, neither of these features can be used if Vsync is active. In addition, Vsync may cause input lag and a drop in performance.\nSLI and Crossfire are techniques to combine two or more video cards to improve the video processing performance on the device.\nWindows Store games don't support these right now which means that only one video card will be used to power these games.\nWindows Store games don't support modifications, say, better texture packs or software like SweetFX, that improve the visual quality of games.\nFraps, MSI Afterburner and other screen recording or FPS monitoring applications are not compatible with Windows Store games either at this point in time.\nIf you want to record games, you need to rely on the built-in recording capabilities instead or find another app that adds the capabilities to the system.\nIf you buy a game on Steam, Origin, uPlay or Gog, you can expect it to run on a variety of operating systems usually.\nRise of the Tomb Raider on Steam is compatible with Windows 7, Windows 8.x and Windows 10, whereas the Windows Store version of the game only with Windows 10.\nYou buy the game once on Steam, and can install it on all supported platforms. Yes, that may include Mac or Linux as well depending on the game.\nThe universal platform offers some benefits when it comes to running Windows Store games. They tie in with several Xbox features for instance, achievements, screen recording and friends you may have on your Xbox One system.\nThe usefulness of most of these features depends largely on how invested you are in Microsoft's Xbox ecosystem.\nIf you own an Xbox One and have friends on the system, you may like the idea that you can buy a game for your console and get the same version for your Windows PC free of charge.\nGames may sync data so that you can continue playing them on either system, and cross-play may also be supported depending on the game.\nThe screen recording is a universal feature, it works with non-Store apps and games as well as it does with them.\nThe UWP is at the beginning of its journey, and it may seem a bit unfair to compare it to established platforms like Steam or PC games in general.\nThe situation may, and probably will, improve in the future when new capabilities and features are added to the platform that games will benefit from.\nFor now however, you may want to weigh up the benefits and disadvantages against each other before you make a buying decision.\nIt is fair to say though that the majority of issues described above won't be noticed or affect the majority of PC gamers."

The Nobel Prizes, of course, have descended into self-parody, what with naming career mediocrity Mohamed El-Baradei and his pitifully inept International Atomic Energy Agency recipients of the once-prestigious Peace Prize, which used to mean something before it was awarded to people like Yasser Arafat, who will go down in history as the man responsible for inventing the airplane hijack.\nAs a friend of First CoffeeSM\u2019s asked, are they going to give it to North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-Il next on the grounds that he could have nuked South Korea but didn\u2019t?\nAnd of course it goes without saying that nobody has ever heard of any of the Literature recipients in the last 20 years \u2013 $10 if you can name last year\u2019s recipient. Give up? Bitter, hateful Austrian novelist Elfreide Jelinek, whose detractors describe her work as turgid, nihilistic, violent, unreadable, sexually brutal sludge and whose supporters describe her work as socially observant turgid, nihilistic, violent, unreadable, sexually brutal sludge.\nFirst CoffeeSM remembers working as a journalist in Istanbul in the 1990s, when Turkish Kurdish novelist Yasar Kemal was yearly touted as a certainty to win, as he was an outspokenly political Kurd at a time when such were fashionable. Only thing is, he didn\u2019t write books anybody outside of Turkish-Kurdish intellectual circles had ever heard of, let alone read. First CoffeeSM struggled through his signature work, Mehmed, My Hawk and hopes never to have to read anything as boring again.\nYet Kemal visited the newspaper First CoffeeSM worked at then, and was a thoroughly gracious man, so it would have been nice to see him win.\nHandicapped as Pamuk is by the fact that he dares to write books people outside of leftist literature faculties like \u2013 Snow and My Name Is Red are good places to start \u2013 he is an acceptably politically outspoken author from a politically trendy country who says politically correct things and gets in trouble with the political authorities for doing so, acts which impress the small-minded, politically-fixated Nobel committee and should balance out the fact that commoners actually read and enjoy his books, usually the kiss of death in Nobel Literature Prize considerations.\nFirst CoffeeSM is considering securing citizenship in Uzbekistan \u2013 no Uzbek author has ever won the Nobel Prize for Literature! What indefensible cultural prejudice! \u2013 adopting the currently popular politically-correct beliefs and churning out childish rants against Worldwide Corporate Hegemony and Western Cultural Imperialism and in a few years cashing a check for 10 million kroner.\nFirst CoffeeSM met the shy yet polite and courteous Pamuk at a party in Istanbul back in those days, he was in the middle of defending himself in some court proceeding for saying something the government didn\u2019t like, and was swapping stories with an American journalist who was also in trouble with the authorities for writing stuff the government didn\u2019t like \u2013 that was back in the era when Turkey was second only to China in the number of journalists killed on the job.\nTo First CoffeeSM\u2019s knowledge no CRM writer has ever been killed on the job.

He's \"that guy,\" one of those constantly working actors who makes any movie or show better.\nYou may not know that he's had an equally celebrated career in the theater and that he's created Beyond Glory, a one-man play that pays tribute to eight Medal of Honor recipients. He's performed the piece over 400 times for theater and military audiences around the world. In 2014, he invited a film crew to join him as he brought the production to the military bases and theaters in America's heartland.\nThe result is Beyond Glory, a documentary/performance hybrid film that follows Lang on tour and manages to include almost a complete performance of the play pieced together from many different shows. The play features Lang's performance as eight men who received the Medal of Honor: Vice Adm. James B. Stockdale, Senator Daniel K. Inouye, First Lt. Vernon Baker, Specialist Clarence Sasser, Staff Sgt. Nick Bacon, Chief Petty Officer John William Finn, Captain Lewis L. Millet and PFC Hector Caffareta.\nYou can buy or rent a digital verison of Beyond Glory now from iTunes, Google Play, Amazon or VUDU. It's also available to rent on demand from many cable and satellite providers.\nStephen Lang talked to us about what motivated him to write and create this show, why he turned it into a movie and offered some insight into how he's enjoyed such a long and successful career. Plus, he offers some insight into what's going on with the four upcoming sequels to Avatar.\nWhat inspired you to write this play? How did this all get started?\nI had reached a point in my life and my career where I wanted to be more proactive, I wanted to initiate something myself, my own kind of project rather than just wait for the telephone to ring. That was back in 2003.\nA guy I used to play ball with was a writer named Larry Smith. He had retired as managing editor of Parade Magazine and just happened to tell me that he had just finished a book of interviews with living Medal of Honor recipients. I expressed a casual interest in reading it. The next time we got together, he brought me an uncorrected copy of it. When I got back from playing ball that afternoon, I just stood there and read it and it knocked me out.\nThat night, I began to kind of noodle around with it. I just intuitively felt that there was something inherently theatrical about it. There were possibilities there. These men interested me. Their stories were incredibly compelling and the men themselves were such vivid and authentic characters that I felt there was dramatic potential.\nI really didn\u2019t start out with anything in mind. I just kept putting one foot in front of the next and wrote this solo performance. It's a piece of theater, but I don\u2019t even really know that it's properly called a play. I found that it was incredibly challenging for me to do. I began working on it and evolving it, first in private and then in a more public setting at my artistic home, The Actor's Studio in New York. At the Actor\u2019s Studio, I did a lot of work, a lot of improv in front of members who would comment on it.\nBefore I knew it, I had ownership in every sense over this piece of work. That was in 2003, the first production was in April 2004 and from then until 2007, I really concentrated on doing Beyond Glory, although I did a few other gigs during that time. Then I put it to bed for a while, because I'd done it a lot.\nWhen I finally did bring it to New York City, James Cameron saw an ad in The New York Times for the play. In the ad, I was looking pretty strapped and military, and Jim began to think of me in terms of Colonel Quaritch in Avatar. And so that became another chapter in my life.\nFrom 2007 to 2013, I did other things. And then I brought Beyond Glory back and began performing it and touring it again and decided to transform it into a film.\nThe film gives a sense that the performance is different every night because you're connecting with the each particular audience.\nAbsolutely. Occasionally, I get asked, \u201cWho's your favorite character?\u201d Of course the answer is it's like deciding who's your favorite child. I don\u2019t have a favorite, but on a nightly basis one or another character can assert themselves in different ways. Each of the characters themselves are capable of having emotional climaxes, both within the context of their own story and within the context of the 80-minute piece.\nThe first character I do is John Finn, who was a navy man, Chief of Ordinance at Kaneohe Bay on December 7, 1941. It\u2019s very appropriate to me to open the piece with the Day of Infamy. When he talks about his wife, Alice, he gets very, very emotional with it. He loves her so deeply, but the truth of the matter is you're only 10 minutes into the play at the time and you don\u2019t want to shoot your emotional wad because you still have got a long way to go. Over the years, I\u2019ve learned how to measure it out in a way, to reign in my own emotions, but nevertheless it changes from night to night.\nYou\u2019ve toured the play at military bases around the world. How is it different performing for an active duty military audience versus a theatrical performance in New York City?\nWhen you perform for a theater audience, you know \"theater audience\" in New York City or in Chicago or in any other kind of theater-savvy town, there's an immediate understanding by the audience of what's being done onstage. There's a certain amount of theatrical sophistication.\nWhen you do it for the troops, many times you're doing it for people who don\u2019t have a hugely vested interest in the theater. It may not be one of the top five things that they enjoy doing and they may not have been exposed to it in the way that many theater-goers are. More than once a guy has come up to me and said, \u201cYou know that\u2019s like the second best play I ever saw.\u201d And I will ask, \u201cWhat was the first best play?\u201d He said, \u201cWell, my sister did The Music Man in junior high. That\u2019s the best.\u201d If a lot of the time that\u2019s the experience they\u2019ve had, that presents its own challenge to me.\nFirst of all, across the board, there's always tremendous appreciation expressed by a military audience quite simply for the fact that you\u2019ve shown up. They really appreciate you being there and that has significance to me. But when they start to dig what's going on, what's happening in the play, when they understand that it's okay to laugh, if I'm successful and really can immerse them in the theater experience, then it can have a really wonderful effect as well.\nWhat I like to think is that so many people join up for all the right reasons, for those reasons that we see in the ads on television. You know what I mean? \u201cBe All That You Can Be.\u201d It portrays this incredibly exciting, inspirational sort of service. Of course, life in the military can be that, but it's also a 24-hour gig that goes on for years and there's an often lot of humdrum routine that\u2019s involved in it as well.\nIf in some way Beyond Glory reminds them of the original intention, of what inspired them to join in the first place, I think that\u2019s a positive as well. I don\u2019t know if it has that effect, but I hope it does.\nI also really like to entertain them with it. To that end, I change the format when I do it for military audiences. I do more of an annotated version of Beyond Glory. I work with a mic in my hand, almost like I'm doing a piece of standup, and I talk.\nI come out and I launch right into a piece. Usually, that\u2019s Nicky Bacon, who is Army down in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, because it's an exciting piece and it's a very jazzy piece and it's kind of a showoff piece. And I just do it. They watch it and then I talk about what I just did. I tell them the bit about Beyond Glory and I tell them a bit about me.\nA lot of times I'll reference other work that I've done, which I know that they\u2019ve probably seen, whether it's Tombstone or Avatar or whatever it may be, because that establishes a connection as well. Then I prepare them and I do another piece for them. Usually, I'll end up doing three or four pieces for them. The military program is usually just about as long as the theatrical piece itself. But in the military version, they get a lot of me as well, not just the characters.\nThe movie is not a straight document of a performance, it's something different. What were you trying to do with your approach to the film?\nAs I say, I'm not sure that the play is in fact a play. I wanted to try to achieve something like that with the film. It's a hybrid and not a straight piece of cinema.\nWhat we wanted to do was we wanted to take the theater experience and use as many elements of cinema as we could to make it an exciting experience. In my view, as a rule, filmed theater does not work particularly well as a movie. If a filmed theater doesn\u2019t work, a film solo show can be even more difficult because it could be extremely static.\nIn the movie, the performance itself is only slightly annotated. You see me offstage making entrances, making exits, you see some interaction, some movement. But I would say the film is 90 percent performance. But it's about 20 different performances in different venues that are hopefully stitched together in a way where you never lose the thread of what's going on, but there\u2019s visual excitement which makes it fun and interesting to watch.\nThe director Larry Brand takes the credit \u201cDirected and Edited by Larry Brand.\u201d He gives the editing equal weight in this. We had a pretty vast amount of performance footage, of performance and he figured how it could be stitched together, knowing you're never going to cover the stitches. The stitches will be visible, there's nothing wrong with that. But you want it to be seamless as well, you wanted it to flow in kind of a natural and exciting way. I thought Larry did a really good job of that. It's a difficult task.\nI probably thought that if I made this film, that maybe I'll stop doing the play because it weighs on you after a while. You know, \u201cTime to make the donuts.\u201d You gotta do the play again. But I don\u2019t think that'll really be the case. I think that I'll probably take a year off and then do it again because it's familiar and it's a real, real good stretch of the muscles for me.\nAre there parts of the play that don\u2019t actually appear the movie?\nYou wouldn\u2019t notice the difference because it's a matter of cutting lines and sections of lines, rather than cutting characters. When I do the play, it's the same eight characters that I do in the movie. We have condensed it a bit and we cut small sections. When I watch the movie, I see the little bit that\u2019s missing. It's kind of appalling to me, because I wrote it and I miss it. It's like, \u201cHow dare he cut that line!\u201d But I understand the need for it.\nThe real answer to that question is that I don\u2019t know if watching the film can ever replace the live performance of a play. It's not intended to, nor should it. Plays are really meant to be seen. What we tried to do is not an approximation, but something that stands on its own that is interesting in a cinematic way as well.\nYou never know when and if I'm gonna do the play again, so it's always nice to know that this film is there. People ask me all the time, \u201cWhen are you gonna take it out, when are you gonna tour it again?\u201d Now I can say, \u201cI\u2019m not sure, but it is available on iTunes,\u201d you know?\nYou\u2019ve had a long and varied career. You\u2019ve done theater, you\u2019ve done \"Law & Order,\" you\u2019ve played a lot of military roles. You're a trained actor. How do you approach your job?\nI've been doing it a long time. There's certainly have been times in my life when I took what was offered because I wanted to work. My wife and I were raising four children. And acting is my livelihood. There were definitely times when it had less to do with how great the role was, how great the project was. It had to do with making a living and there's sure nothing wrong with that.\nAs time goes on, I am fortunate in that I'm able to bounce between mediums with ease. I can work onstage, on television, or in film without any problem. It's a known fact that I can do it and I'm happy to do it. I love to bounce back and forth.\nI can't say that there has been a gameplan or a blueprint. You see what's available and you accept what really appeals to you. Once in a while you get very fortunate and something that you do turns out to be incredibly successful and it may move you along, it may move you up a rung in terms of your career. Certainly something like Death of a Salesman did do that for me. It took me from being kind of an unknown, younger actor to being a little more well-known actor.\nAt some point I think it really dates to A Few Good Men on Broadway. Military roles just started coming my way. And I think it's great at this point I know that I'm in the equation. If something like that comes up, I'm not always gonna get it, I may not always want to do it.\nTake a movie like Beyond Valkyrie.That was a case where they called and they could shoot my role in four days. We looked at the schedule and I thought the script was fine and the role not difficult for me to do. There was no reason not to do that one. The fact that it may not get a huge release, that doesn\u2019t concern me in the least because I know I'm doing other pictures that are gonna get a huge release.\nIn terms of Valkyrie, I actually think that they were pleased enough with the finished movie that they did open it in theaters, which is an absolute delight for the director. He is just completely thrilled about that. Me, I'm cool one way or the other.\nSo I guess the short answer is this: at this point I look at what's available and if I feel like it's worthwhile or if it's gonna challenge me, and I'm free, then I'll do it. You have to be flexible in your thinking.\nYou\u2019ve got three \"Avatar\" sequels on the schedule. Have you shot those yet or is that going to be done in pieces?\nWell, we've actually got four. We're doing four more Avatars. It turned into four because the story was really, really vast, is vast. And Jim couldn\u2019t tell it in three, so we're doing four.\nWe haven't rolled camera on it because the last couple of years have really been about getting the scripts in absolutely pristine shape, in the shape that Jim Cameron really demands of himself, before we roll camera on it.\nThere's been a huge amount of preproduction work that\u2019s been going on for a long time in terms of character design, in terms of the environment, the environments that are being created for it, because so much of that is generated in computer workshops. My job has been tough, which is to say it's been to stay in shape and to just be ready and to give Jim comments when it's appropriate to do so.\nI really can't say anything about the story. I can say that Colonel Quaritch returns even though he was killed in the first movie. It is science fiction, and his return seems organic and natural and he appears in all the films. I can say that, because that\u2019s a matter of public record that Cameron has said it himself at this point. I'm really looking forward to getting to work.\nJames Cameron has always tried to push things technically as much as possible when he makes a film. Have you been involved in the testing of the new tech? Have you been scanned for these movies?\nI've been scanned a number of times. I haven't been scanned lately, but it's all in the bank, as it were. All the assets are there. They could recreate me out there as we speak right now with what they\u2019ve got in the scans, but I have no doubt that we'll be redoing all kinds of new things.\nWhat Jim does, in my view, is that he writes and creates kind of these challenges for himself. A lot of times they're technical challenges in order to tell the story the way it needs to be told. For it to happen, he's kind of got to invent a new lens or a new way of shooting something.\nI don\u2019t think it's any secret to say that Jim has always been involved in underwater work. He loves it. There will be a certain amount of water work in these four movies, and that\u2019s gonna require some real new technologies to do that, some advanced stuff to get that done correctly."

        "output": "Cavaliers center Shaquille O'Neal will have surgery on his sprained right thumb on Monday morning in Baltimore, which likely will mean he will be out for the remainder of the regular season.\nThough the Cavs did not place any timetable on O'Neal's return, injuries of this nature that require surgery typically take six to nine weeks to heal. In 1995, O'Neal suffered a torn ligament in the thumb that caused him to miss 22 games for the Orlando Magic. There are seven weeks remaining in the regular season.\nThe Cavs obtained O'Neal in a trade with the Phoenix Suns last June in order to counter the height problems posed by the Boston Celtics, Orlando Magic and Los Angeles Lakers in the playoffs. Provided the Cavs can continue to hold onto the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference, they likely wouldn't face Boston or Orlando until at least the second round, by which time O'Neal could be back.\nBut it remains to be seen what O'Neal's absence will mean to the Cavs' attempt to finish with the best record in the league, which would give them home-court advantage throughout the playoffs. They currently have the best record in the league at 46-14 heading into Monday night's home game against New York. Los Angeles is 45-15.\nCavaliers coach Mike Brown acknowledged how much the team would miss O'Neal, whose contributions have gone far beyond his averages of 12 points and 6.7 rebounds in 53 games this season.\n\"There have been plenty of games that he's played for us where without him, we probably wouldn't have won,\" Brown said after Sunday's practice before O'Neal's surgery was announced. \"He has had an impact against the Lakers. He has had an impact against Orlando. He has had an impact against a lot of teams, especially when Mo [Williams] was out and Delonte [West] was out.\n\"We won 13 in a row and he was a big part of it. He allowed us to still be able to score buckets easily in the halfcourt.\"\nJohn Kuntz / The Plain Dealer Anderson Varejao was the starting center in Friday's win at Toronto, but struggled with fouls. He'll need to be able to stay on the court while the Cavaliers are shorthanded.\nBrown will start Anderson Varejao in O'Neal's place and also use J.J. Hickson, Antawn Jamison and Leon Powe at center.\n\"It impacts everybody's game when you don't have a presence like Shaq around,\" Brown said. \"I think your team is different. He's hard to replace on both ends of the floor.\n\"We don't have a power inside presence that we're able to come down and play the ball into. We're going to try to spread teams out a little bit more and play a little more pick and roll after a little bit of movement, play some catch-and-shoot and post up our smalls a little bit more.\"\nO'Neal suffered the injury on Thurday at Boston, where Glen \"Big Baby\" Davis hit his hand while he was shooting. Television replays later showed Davis pulling on the thumb while defending O'Neal.\nO'Neal had an MRI on the thumb on Saturday at The Cleveland Clinic. On Sunday, O'Neal and Cavaliers team physician Dr. Richard Parker visited Dr. Thomas Graham at the National Hand Center in Baltimore. Graham is a renowned hand surgeon who operated on former Cav Larry Hughes in 2006. The surgery will be at Union Memorial Hospital in Baltimore. It will be performed by Dr. Graham, with Dr. Parker assisting.\nThe Cavs will update O'Neal's status after the surgery.\nThe Cavs had two All-Star centers at the start of the season and now they have none. Zydrunas Ilgauskas was sent to Washington in the deal that brought Jamison from the Wizards. Ilgauskas was released by the Wizards and will clear waivers and become a free agent on Monday. If he decides to re-sign with the Cavs, the earliest he can do so is March 22, according to league rules.\nIlgauskas' agent, Herb Rudoy, denied a report on ESPN.com on Sunday that he had told the Dallas Mavericks that Ilgauskas was going to re-sign with the Cavaliers as soon as possible.\nRudoy said he had not talked to Mavericks General Manager Donnie Nelson in days.\n\"No decision has been made,\" Rudoy insisted in an email on Sunday night.\nJames, Varejao rest: James and Varejao received treatment on Sunday and did not practice. James suffered a bruised left thigh when he was kneed by the Raptors' Antoine Wright in the first half at Toronto on Friday."
